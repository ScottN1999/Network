# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query langauge, it allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS

Database engines managed by AWS:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- MSFT SQL server
- IBM DB2
- Aurora (AWS Proprietary db)

## Advantages of RDS > Database in EC2

RDS is a managed service (not serverless), AWS provides services like:
- Automated provisioning, OS patching
- Continous backups and restore to specific timestamp (point in time restore)!
- Monitoring dashboards
- **Read replicas for improved read performance**
- Multi AZ setup for DR
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capabilities both horizontal and vertical
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)

**YOU CANNOT SSH INTO RDS INSTANCES**

## RDS Storage Auto Scaling
As what you would expect, it increases the storage of a RDS instance dynamically - when RDS detects you are running out of free space, it will scale more storage for you.

Important to know is that you must set a **Maximum storage threshold**

It will automatically modify storage if:
- Free storage is less than 10% of allocated space
- Low-stroage lasts at least 5 minutes
- 6 hour have passed since last modification

Useful for applications with unpredicatable workloads, support across all RDS db engines

# RDS Read Replicas and Multi AZ

## Read Replicas
You can have up to 15 read replicas, they can be within the AZ, Cross AZ, or even cross region

Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent - what this means is because the replicas are eventually consistent, therefore meaning that if the application reads the read replica before synicing with the primary instance - it might be old data.

Replicas can be promoted to their own DB. Slave > master (probe > master)

Application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas.

**Use case for read replicas**
You have a production db that is taking on normal load, a team reaches out to run a reporting application to run some analytics on said DB - you are worried because that DB is already pretty overworked and might lead to negative performance. We create a read replica to run the new workload there so that the reporting application reads off the replica and the production application is unaffected. Read replicas are used for SQDL SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (these are all writes))

**Cost of using replicas:**
In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another, however there is exceptions - usually AWS managed services (like RDS). For RDS read replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee - however cross region you do pay:

## RDS Multi AZ (DR)

SYNC replication, one DNS name - automatic app failover to standby (think of it as a cold standby appliance) - this increases availability as if something goes wrong we have something to fall back on (not scalability)

Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure - this requires no intervention in apps.

**Note: The read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for DR**

## RDS from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ
- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB), just click on "modify" for the database.

- What happens internally:
- - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - Synchronization is established between the two DBs

**RDS Custom**
Managed Oracle and MSFT SQL Server database with OS and database customisation

RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of databases in AWS.

Custom; Access to the underlying database and OS so you canL
- Configure settings
- Install patches
- Enable native features
- Access to underlying EC2 instances use SSH or SSM Session Manager

De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customisation, better take an DB snapshot before (can easily break stuff)

RDS vs RDS Custom
- RDS: Entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
- RDS custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the DB

## AWS Aurora
Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)

Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Auora was a Postgres or MySQL database).

Aurora is "AWS cloud optimised" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x of postgres on RDS

Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128TB. It can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10ms replica lag).

Failover in Aurora is instant, it's HA native - however with these benefits it's going to cost 20% more than RDS > but with it's pros it's considered more effecient

## Aurora HA and Read Scaling
- 6 Copies of your data across 3 AZ:
  - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
  - 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
  - Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
  - Storage is striped across 100s of volumes

One Aurora instance takes writes (master), automated failover for master in less than 30s. (can have master + up to 15 Aurora read replicas serve reads) Support for cross region replication

Replicas can autoscale so there is an increase in reader endpoints:

**Aurora - Custom endpoints**

Define a subset of Aurora instances as a custom endpoint
Example: Run analytical queries on specific replicas
The reader endpoint is generally not used after defining custom endpoints

**Aurora Serverless**

- Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
- No Capacity planning needed
- Pay per second - can be more cost-effective

**Global Aurora**
- Aurora cross region read replicas:
  - Useful for DR
  - Simple to put in place

- Aurora Global DB **(RECOMMENDED)**
  - 1 primary region (read/write)
  - up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lags is less than 1s
  - Up to 16 read replicas per secondary region
  - Helps decreasing latency
  - Promoting another region (for DR) has an RTO (recovery time objective) of < 1 min
  - **Typical cross-region replication takes less than 1 second**
 
**Aurora Machine Learning**
- Enables you to add ML-based predictions to your apps via SQL
- Simple, optimised, and secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML services

- Supported Services:
  - AWS SageMaker (Use with any ML model)
  - AWS Comprehend (For sentiment analysis)

Use cases: fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendations

## RDS Backups

Automated backups:
- Daily full backup of the database (during the backup window)
- Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5mins
- => ability to restore any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 mins ago)
- 1 to 35 days retention, set 0 to disabled automated backups

Manual DB Snapshots:
- Manually triggered
- Retention of backup for as long as u want

Trick: In a stopped RDS DB, you will stay for storage. If you plan on stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot and restore instead

## Aurora backups

**Automated backups**
- 1 to 35 days (**cannot be disabled)**
- point-in-time recovery in that timeframe

Manual DB Snapshots
- Manually triggered
- retention of backup for as long as u want

## RDS and Aurora Restore options

Restoring a RDS/Aurora backup or a snapshot creates a new db

Restoring a MySQL RDS db from S3
- Create a backup of your on-premises database
- store it on S3
- Restore the backup file onto a new RDS instance running MySQL

Restoring MySQL Aurora Cluster from S3
- Create a backup of your onprem db using Percona XtraBackup
- Store the backup in S3
- Restore the backup file into a new Aurora cluster running MySQL

## Aurora DB cloning

Create a new Aurora DB cluster from an existing one. This is faster than snapshot and restore because it uses copy-on-write protocol
  - Initially the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original cluster (faster and efficient - no copying is needed)
  - When updates are made to the new DB cluster data, then additional storage is allocated and data is copied to be seperated
Very fast and cost effective
Useful to create a "staging" db from a "prod" db without impacting the prod db

## RDS and Aurora Security
**At-rest encryption:**
- DB master and replicas encryption using KMS - must be defines as launch time
- if the master is not encrypted, the read replicas wont be encrypted
- To encrypt and unencrypted db, go through a snapshot and restore as encrypted

**In flight encryption:** TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certs client-side

**IAM Authentication:** IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pw)

**NSG**: Controll access to instances

**No SSH Avaialable**: Except for RDS custom

**Audit logs can be enabled**: Sent to CloudWatch logs if longer retention needed

## RDS Proxy
Can deploy fully managed DB proxy for RDS, this will allow apps to pool and share DB connections established with the DB.

This will improve DB effeciency by reducing the stress on db resources (cpu, ram) and minimize open connections (and timeouts). It's serverless, autoscaling, and HA (multi-az)

Reduces RDS and Aurora failover time by up 66%

**Enforce IAM Authentication for DB, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager**

RDS proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC (improving sec))

## ElastiCache

The same way RDS to get managed Relational DB... ElasticCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached - Caches are in-memory DBs with really high performance, low latency

Helps reduce load off DBs for read intensive workloads, helps your application stateless.

AWS takes care of OS maintenance/patching, optimizations, setup, config, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

**Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes**

**How it works**

Application queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache > helps relieve load in RDS

Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there (can be difficult)


<img width="256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/91d4f09c-9c50-4e69-8daa-f47c132d7ecf">

**User Session Store**

User logs into any of the application, the application write the session data into ElastiCache - the user hits another instance of our application - the instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in

<img width="257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/c79fb893-ca80-48f6-9707-8147dd615606">

## Redis Vs Memcached

**Redis**
- Multi AZ with Auto-failover
- Read replicas to scale reads and have HA
- Data durability use AOF persistence
- Backup and restore features
- Supports Sets and Sorted Sets

<img width="144" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/d4351a5d-504a-461e-9cc6-ecea3c6fbfa7">

**Memcached**
- Multinode for partitioning of data (sharding)
- No HA (Replication)
- Non persistent
- No backup and restore
- Multi-threaded architecture (execute two or more concurrent processes)

<img width="142" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/836ac934-8835-41cd-86a7-34e0f72e69f0">

## ElastiCache Security
- ElastiCache Supports **IAM Authentication for Redis**
- IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis Auth (sec within redis)
  - You can set a "password/token" when you create a Redis cluster
  - This is an extra level of sec for your cache (on top of security groups)
  - Supports SSL in flight encryption

Memcached
- Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

## Patterns of load for ElastiCache
**Lazy Loading**
- All the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache
  
<img width="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/fbe64159-e968-44ce-a744-74614b61f7b0">

**Write Through**
- Adds or update data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale data)

**Session Store**
- Store temporary session data in a cacche (using TTL features)

Cache is considered difficult

## Redis Use Case
Gaming leaderboards are computationally complex, **Redis sorted sets** guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering. Each time a new element is added, it's ranked in real time, then added in correct order.
