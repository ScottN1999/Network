# S3 Security


## S3 Object Encryption

Can be done in 4 methods:

- **Server-side encryption (SSE)**
  - Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) - **Enabled by default**
    - Encrypts S3 Objects using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
  - Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
    - Leverages AWS Key Managment Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys
  - Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SEE-C)
    - When you want to managed your own encryption keys

- **Client-Side Encryption**
Encrypting the data client side before it hits the bucket

## SSE-S3

Encryption using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS - encryption type is AES-256 therefore must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

SSE-S3 is enabled by default for new buckets and objects

## SSE-KMS

Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS, KMS advantages: User control + audit key usage using CloudTrail

- Object is encrypted server-side. Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"

**Limitiations** 
If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by KMS limits, when you upload, it calls the **GenerateDataKey** KMS API and when you download it called the **Decrypt** KMS API.

These count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region).

## SSE - C
Server-Side encryption using keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS - Amazon S3 does NOT store the encryption key you provide.

- HTTPS must be used - Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

## Client-Side Encryption
Use client libraries such as **Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library** - client must encrpt data themselves before sending to S3 and clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3 (customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle)

## Encryption in Transit (SSL/TLS)

S3 exposes two endpointsL
  - HTTP unencrypted, HTTPS encrypted duh

HTTPS is recommended and mandatory for SSE-C

This can be forced by a bucket policy through aws:SecureTransport:
