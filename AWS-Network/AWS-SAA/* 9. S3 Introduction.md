## Buckets

S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories), buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts). S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
Naming convention:
- No uppercase, no underscore
- 3-63 char long
- Not and IP
- Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Must NOT start with prefix xn--
- Must NOT end with the suff -s3alias

## Objects
Objects (files) have a Key. The **KEY** is the **_FULL_** path:
- s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt** (for nested folders)

The key is composed of **prefix** + _object name_
- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder/another_folder/**_my_file.txt_
