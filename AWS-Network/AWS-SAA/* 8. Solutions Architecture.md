**VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM**

## Stateless app (in this exampe just telling the time)

- Understanding Public vs Private IP and EC2 instances
- Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load balancers
- Route 53 TTL, A records and Alias recourds
- Maintaining EC2 instance manually vs ASG
- Multi-az to survive disasters
- ELB health checks
- Security group rules
- Reservation of capacity for cost savings
- We're considering 5 pillars for a well architected application:
  - Costs (reservation of EC2s rather than on-demand pricing, ASG to ensure we only use EC2s on what we need)
  - Performance (Vertical scaling, ELBs and ASGs)
  - Reliability (Multi AZ, and route 53)
  - Security (Security groups for ELBs and EC2 comms)
  - Operational excellence (fixing the 1 t2 micro being overloaded)

## Stateful App (in this example a shopping cart, and user details in DB)

The problem:

Updated the shopping cart and that traffic goes to a different instance, resulting in the shopping cart being lost - refreshes and causes more issues.

To fix:
ELB stickiness (session affinity)

But what if the ec2 dies? we lose our session. **Solution** User cookies, regardless of which EC2 it talks to, because the user tells the EC2 what's in it.

The solution is stateless, however the HTTP requests becom heavier, there is security risks (cookies can be altered), cookies must be validated and must be less than 4kb (so we're limited)

**What next?**

Server sessions:

* Could also use DynamoDB

More secure as attackers can't modiy cookies now.

## For database

Scaled instances can read from the read replicas rather than always hitting the RDS master we could also use lazy loading with ElastiCache

## Lets add HA for durability

- Add Multi AZ for RDS, and ElastiCache Redis Multi AZ

## For security

- The ELB will allow 80 and 443 for any IP
- However we will restrict traffic on the private instances, therefore public traffic to EC2, and traffic from the EC2 to the ElastiCache or RDS

**Key points**
- ELB sticky sessions for when the user was getting their cart fked
- Web clients for storing cookies and making the web app stateless (regardless of where the ELB takes them)
- - ElastiCache
    - For storing sessions (can also use DynamoDB)
    - For caching data from RDS
    - Multi AZ with Redis not Memcached
  - RDS
    - Storing user data
    - Read replicas for scaling reads
    - Multi AZ for durability
  Tightened security with NSGs referencing each other
