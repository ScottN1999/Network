# Decoupling

When we start deploying mulitple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another - there are two patterns of application communication:

1. Synchronous communications (application to application)

Between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic - we to **decouple applications**

2. Asynchronous / Event based (applications to queue to application)

## Decoupling

We can decouple with the help of:
- Using SQS - Queue model
- SNS - Pub/sub model
- Kinesis - real-time streaming model
