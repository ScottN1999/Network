## Elastic Compute Cloud

EC2 is one the most popular AWS' offering, is a VM > IaaS

Has the capability of:
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

### EC2 Sizing and config options
- Operating system: Linux, Windows or Mac
- How much computer power and cores (CPU)
- How much memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
    - Network-attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
- Network card: speed of the card, public IP
- Firewall rules: Network security groups (NSG)
- Bootstrap script (config at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script, bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts. That script is only run once at the instance first start.

EC2 User data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading common files from the internet
- anything you can think of

The EC2 User data script runs with the root user.

T2.micro is parth of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

### EC2 Instance Types

Example: m5.2xlarge <br>
m = instance class <br>
5 = generation (AWS improves them over time) <br>
2xlarge = size within the instance class <br>

**General Purpose**
Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories, has a good balance between:
    - Compute
    - Memory
    - Networking

<br>

**Compute Optimised**
Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high permonance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High perf web servers
  - High performance computing
  - Gaming servers
  - Scientific modeling and machine learning

<br>

**Memory Optimised**
  Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
  <br>
  Use case:
    - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
    - Distributed web scale cache stores
    - In-memory databases for BI (Business intelligence)
    - Appliactions performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

<br>

**Storage Optimised**
Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

<br>
Use case:
- High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP) systems
- Relational & NoSQL databases
- Cache for in-memory databases (e.g. Redis)
- Data warehousing applications
- Distributed file systems
