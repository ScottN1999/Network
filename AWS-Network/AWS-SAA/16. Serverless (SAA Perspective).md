# AWS Lambda

Easy pricing 
- Pay per request and compute time
- Free tier of 1 million Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time

It is integrated with the whole suite of AWS services - as well with many programming languages.

Easy monitoring through CloudWatch - easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM), increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

## Lambda Limits 

**Per-region**

**Execution**

- Memory allocation : 128 MB - 10GB (1 MB increments)
- Maximum execution time: 15 minutes
- Environment variables: 4kb
- Disk cap in the "function container" (in /tmp): 512MB to 10GB
- Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)

**Deployment:**

- Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
- Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
- Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup
- Size of environment variables: 4KB

## Lambda SnapStart

Improve your Lambda functions performance up to 10x at no extra cost for Java 11 and above.

When it's enabled, function is invoked from a pre-intialized state (no function initialization from scratch)

When you publish a new version:
- Lambda initalizes your function
- Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function
- Snapshot is cached for low-latency access
