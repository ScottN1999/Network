# CloudFront

A content delivery network (CDN), it improves read performance, content is caches at the edge (improves user experience)

216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)

With it having so many edge locations it comes with DDoS protection (because it's world wide) Integration with Shield, AWS WAF

## s3 Origins

- S3 Bucket
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhances security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
  - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)

- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - ALB
  - EC2
  - S3 Website (must first enable to bucket as a static S3 website)
  - Any HTTP backend you want

## CloudFront at a high level

CloudFront for S3

## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

CloudFront:

- Global Edge network
- Files are cache for a TTL (maybe a day)
- Great for static content that must be available everywhere

S3 Cross Region Replication
- Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
- Files are updated in near real time
- Read only
- Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

## CloudFront - ALB or EC2 as an origin

## CloudFront - Pricing

The cost of data out per edge location varies

**Price Classes**

You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction

3 classes:
- Price Class All: all regions - best performance
- Price Class 200: Most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
- Price Class 100: Only the least expensive regions

## CloudFront - Cache Invalidations

In case you update back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired.

However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a **CloudFront Invalidation**. You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)

## AWS Global Accelerator 

Problem: You have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly - they go over the public internet which can add a lot of latency due to many hops

**Unicast Vs Anycast IP**

Unicast: One server holds one IP address

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/58b3dca1-0f7d-4dfe-b65a-42a3cc01e9be)

Anycast IP: All servers hold the same IP address and the clients is routed to the nearest one

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/91087aed-a8e5-4247-b5c9-e92068ddf1bc)

**THIS IS HOW GLOBAL ACCELERATOR WORKS - ANYCAST IPS**

Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application - it will talk to the closest edge location

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/39f07cfa-6a4d-49a1-a82d-aba7bdc4eedd)

2 Anycast IP are created for your application > the anycast IP send traffic directly to edge locations > then the edge location will send the traffic to your application


**Works with Elastic IP, EC2, ALB, NLB, Public or private**

- Consistent Performance
  - Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
  - No issue  with client cache (because IP doesn't change)
  - Internal AWS network

- Health checks
  - Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications
  - Helps make your app global (failover less than 1 min for unhealthy)
  - Great for DR (due to healthchecks)

- Security
  - Only 2 external IPs need to be whitelisted
  - DDoS protection due to AWS Shield

## CloudFront vs Accelerator

- Both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS shield for DDOS protection

**CloudFront**
- Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
- Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
- Content is served at the edge

**Global Accelerator**
- Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
- Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions.
- Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (mqtt), or VOIP
- Good for HTTP use cases that require static IPs
- Good for HTTP use cases that require deterministic, fast regional failover
