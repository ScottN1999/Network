# AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

Anytime you hear encryption for an AWS service, most likely will be KMS.

With KMS, AWS manages encryption keys for us > an easy way to to control access your data.

Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail.

**Never store your secrets in plaintext, especially in code!**
  - KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI)

## KMS Keys Types

**Symmetric (AES-256 Keys)**
  - Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
  - AWS Services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
  - You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)

**Asymmetric (RSA and ECC key pairs)**
  - Public (Encrypt) and Private key (Decrypt) pair
  - Used for Encrypt/Decrpyth, or Sign/verify operations
  - Use case: Encryption outside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API

Types of KMS Keys:

  - AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)
  - AWS Managed Key: **free** (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)
  - Customer managed keys created in KMS: **$1/month**
  - Customer managed keys imported: **$1/month**
  - + pay for API calls to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

Automatic Key rotation
  - AWS-managed KMS key: automatic every 1 year
  - Customer-managed KMS key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
  - Imported KMS key: only manual rotation possible using alias
