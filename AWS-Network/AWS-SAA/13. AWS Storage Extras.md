# Other Storage Stuff

## AWS Snow Family

Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process at the edge, and migrate data inot and out of AWS

Data migration:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge
- Snowmobile (mf truck carrying a storage container)

Edge computing:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge

**Data Migration with Snow**

In general it takes this long usually (not SNOW)

Challenges:
- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
- Connection stability

**Why Snow?** If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices which allows data migration offline

## Snowball Edge

Physical data transport solution: Moves TBs or POVs of data in or out of AWS - Alternative to moving data over the network and paying network fees.

Pay per data transfer job. Provide block storage and S3-compatible object storage.

There is 2 classes:
- Snowball Edge Storage optimised
  - 80 TB of HDD or 210TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage

- Snowball Edge Compute Optimised
  - 42 TB of HDD or 28TB VNME capacity for block and S3

## Snowcone 

Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged and secure, withstands harsh environments

Light (2.1kg) - this device is used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer. 

Snowcone - 8tb of HDD 
Snowcone SSD - 14tb of SSD

Use snowcone where Snowball doesn't fit (space-constrained environment) must provide your own battery / cables

2 options to send data back to AWS: Sent offline, or connect it internet and use AWS DataSync to send it back

## Snowmobile (IN MARCH 2024 AWS QUIETLY REMOVED FROM THEIR WEBSITE RIP MY FAV SERVICE :((( )

Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)

Each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (1 EB will require 10 snowmobiles)

High security, temp controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance.

Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB
