# Other Storage Stuff

## AWS Snow Family

Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process at the edge, and migrate data inot and out of AWS

Data migration:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge
- Snowmobile (mf truck carrying a storage container)

Edge computing:
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge

**Data Migration with Snow**

In general it takes this long usually (not SNOW)

Challenges:
- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
- Connection stability

**Why Snow?** If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices which allows data migration offline

## Snowball Edge

Physical data transport solution: Moves TBs or POVs of data in or out of AWS - Alternative to moving data over the network and paying network fees.

Pay per data transfer job. Provide block storage and S3-compatible object storage.

There is 2 classes:
- Snowball Edge Storage optimised
  - 80 TB of HDD or 210TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage

- Snowball Edge Compute Optimised
  - 42 TB of HDD or 28TB VNME capacity for block and S3

## Snowcone 

Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged and secure, withstands harsh environments

Light (2.1kg) - this device is used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer. 

Snowcone - 8tb of HDD 
Snowcone SSD - 14tb of SSD

Use snowcone where Snowball doesn't fit (space-constrained environment) must provide your own battery / cables

2 options to send data back to AWS: Sent offline, or connect it internet and use AWS DataSync to send it back

## Snowmobile (IN MARCH 2024 AWS QUIETLY REMOVED FROM THEIR WEBSITE RIP MY FAV SERVICE :((( )

Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)

Each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (1 EB will require 10 snowmobiles)

High security, temp controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance.

Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB

**Snowball into Glacier**

Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly

You must use S3 first, in combination with an s3 lifecycle policy

## Amazon FSx

Launch 3rd part high-performance file systems on AWS **fully managed service**.

Could be:
- FSx for Lustre
- FSx for Windows File Server
- FSx for NetApp ONTAP
- FSx for OpenZFS

## FSx for Windows File Server

FSx for Windows is a fully managed Windows file system share drive - supports SMF protocol and Windows NTFS. Has MSFT AD integration, ACLs, and user quotas.

**Can be mounted on Linux EC2s**

Supports Microsoft's Distrubuted File System (DFS) Namespaces (group files across multiple FS)

- Scale up to 10s of HB/S, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data

Storage Options:
- SSD: Latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, ...)
- HDD: Broad spectrum workloads (home directory, CMS,...)

Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastrcuture (VPN or Direct Connect)
Can be configured to be Multi-AZ and data is backed up daily to S3.

## FSx for Lustre
Lustre is type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing - the name Lustre is derive from "Linux" and "cluster"

When thinking of Lustre, it's important to mention it's for **High Performance Computing (HPC)** - think examples like Machine Learning, Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation. 

Scales up to 100s GB/S, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies.

Storage Options:
- SSD - Low latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small and random file operations
- HDD: Throughput-intensive workloads, large and sequential file operations

**Seamless integration with S3**
- Can't "read S3" as a filesystem (through FSx)
- Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)

Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastrcuture (VPN or Direct Connect)

## FSx File System Deployment Options

- **Scratch File System**
  - Temporary storage
  - Data is not replicated (doesn't persist if file server fails)
  - High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
  - Usage: Short-term processing, optimize costs

- **Persistent File System**
  - Long-term storage
  - Data is replicated within same AZ
  - Replace failed files within minutes
  - Usage: long-term processing, sensitive data

## FSx for NetApp ONTAP

Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS > file system compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol. Move workloads running ONTAP or NAS to AWS

Works with:
- Linux
- Windows
- Mac
- VMWare Cloud on AWS
- Amazon Workspaces and AppStream 2.0
- EC2, ECS, EKS

Storage shrinks or grows automatically.

Snapshots, replication, low-cost, compression, and data de-duplucation

**Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)**

## FSx for OpenZFS

Managed OpenZFS file system on AWS - file system compatible with NFS (v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2). 

Move workloads running on ZFS to AWS
