# S3 Security


## S3 Object Encryption

Can be done in 4 methods:

- **Server-side encryption (SSE)**
  - Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) - **Enabled by default**
    - Encrypts S3 Objects using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
  - Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
    - Leverages AWS Key Managment Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys
  - Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SEE-C)
    - When you want to managed your own encryption keys

- **Client-Side Encryption**
Encrypting the data client side before it hits the bucket

## SSE-S3

Encryption using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS - encryption type is AES-256 therefore must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

SSE-S3 is enabled by default for new buckets and objects

## SSE-KMS

Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS, KMS advantages: User control + audit key usage using CloudTrail

- Object is encrypted server-side. Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"

**Limitiations** 
If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by KMS limits, when you upload, it calls the **GenerateDataKey** KMS API and when you download it called the **Decrypt** KMS API.

These count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region).

## SSE - C
Server-Side encryption using keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS - Amazon S3 does NOT store the encryption key you provide.

- HTTPS must be used - Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

## Client-Side Encryption
Use client libraries such as **Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library** - client must encrpt data themselves before sending to S3 and clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3 (customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle)

## Encryption in Transit (SSL/TLS)

S3 exposes two endpointsL
  - HTTP unencrypted, HTTPS encrypted duh

HTTPS is recommended and mandatory for SSE-C

This can be forced by a bucket policy through aws:SecureTransport:

## Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies

- SSE-S3 is automatically applied to new objects stored in S3 Bucket, optionally - you can "force encryption" using a bucket policy and refuse any API call to PUT an S3 without encryption headers (SSE-KMS or SSE-C)

**Note: Bucket Policies are evaluate before "Default Encryption"**

## AWS Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Origin = scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port
  - Example: https://www.example.com (implied port is 443 for https)

CORS is a **web browser** based mechanism to allow or deny requests to other origins while visiting the main origin

Same origins look like: **http://example.com**/app1 and **http://example.com**/app2 (same host and protocol http | port 80)

different origins could look like: **http://example.com** and _http://other.example.com_

The requests won't be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using CORS Headers (e.g. Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

## WTF does this gotta do with S3

If a client makes a cross-region request on our S3 Bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers - you can allow for a specific origin or for * (all origins).

## S3 MFA Delete

Can allow MFA to be a requirement for:
- Permanently delete a object version
- SuspendVersioning on the bucket

MFA won't be required to:
- Enable versioning
- List deleted versions

To use MFA Delete, **Versioning must be enabled on the bucket** 

**Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA delete** interesting an IAM user cannot do this

## S3 Access Logs
For audit purposes, may be a good idea - any request made to S3, from any account, unauthorised or denied, will be logged into another s3 bucket - that can be alaysed using data analysis tools (e.g. Athena).

**The target locking bucket must be in the same AWS region**

Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket, this will create a logging loop and your bucket will grow exponentially. _this will make bezos very happy if you do so_
