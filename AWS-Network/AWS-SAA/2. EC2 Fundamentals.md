## Elastic Compute Cloud

EC2 is one the most popular AWS' offering, is a VM > IaaS

Has the capability of:
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

### EC2 Sizing and config options
- Operating system: Linux, Windows or Mac
- How much computer power and cores (CPU)
- How much memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
    - Network-attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
- Network card: speed of the card, public IP
- Firewall rules: Network security groups (NSG)
- Bootstrap script (config at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script, bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts. That script is only run once at the instance first start.

EC2 User data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading common files from the internet
- anything you can think of

The EC2 User data script runs with the root user.

T2.micro is parth of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

### EC2 Instance Types

Example: m5.2xlarge <br>
m = instance class <br>
5 = generation (AWS improves them over time) <br>
2xlarge = size within the instance class <br>

**General Purpose**
Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories, has a good balance between:
- Compute
- Memory
- Networking

**Compute Optimised**
Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high permonance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High perf web servers
  - High performance computing
  - Gaming servers
  - Scientific modeling and machine learning

**Memory Optimised**
Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory

Use case:
- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
- Distributed web scale cache stores
- In-memory databases for BI (Business intelligence)
- Appliactions performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

**Storage Optimised**
Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

Use case:
- High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP) systems
- Relational & NoSQL databases
- Cache for in-memory databases (e.g. Redis)
- Data warehousing applications
- Distributed file systems

### Network Security Groups

Security groups are fundamental network security - controls traffic of our EC2 instances.

Security groups only contain **allow rules**, security group rules can reference by IP or by security group.

They regulated:
- Access to ports
- Authorise IP ranged - IPv4 and IPv6
- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

### NSG good to knows
Can be attached to multiple instances, they are locked down to a region / VPC combination. Does live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 won't see it. It's good to maintain one seperate NSG for SSH access, note if your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a NSG issue however if connections refused error then its an application issue.

- All inbound traffic is **blocked** by default
- All outbound traffic is **allowed** by default

If one VM has a shared NSG, they can communicate with one another and you don't have to worry about IPs as much - in the screenshot you can see the third VM fails.

**Ports to know**
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into instance
- 21 = FTP (File transfer) - Upload files into file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure FTP) - Upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - Unencrypted HTTP
- 443 = HTTPS - Encrypted
- 3389 = RDP (Remote desktop protocol) - Remoting into windows pc

**Connecting to VMs**
