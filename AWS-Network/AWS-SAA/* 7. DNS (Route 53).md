# Route 53

**What is DNS**

Domain Name System which translates human friendly hostnames into machine IPs > www.google.com = 172.16.1.3

DNS is the backbone of the internet - there is a hierarchical name stucture

## DNS terms

**Domain Registrar:** Where you register your domain names - Route53, GoDaddy, ...
**DNS Records:** A,AAAA,CNAME,NS, ...
**Zone file:** Contains all the DNS records - how to match hostnames to addresses
**Name server:** Resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or non-authoritative)
**Top Level Domain (TLD):** .com, .gov, .org
**Second Level Domain (SLD):** amazon.com, google.com

## How DNS works

<img width="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/ac12e284-dae8-4bab-b906-81a5b97396e1">

Your web browser will ask your local DNS server (managed by ISP/your company) if it has ever seen the example.com domain - if it has not been cache'd it will then ask the root dns and recursively find it, each DNS server provides some details (e.g. The root dns server will know .com's name server is IP: 1.2.3.4)

## Route 53

High available, scalable, full managed and _authoritative DNS_
  - **Authorative** = the customer (you) can update the DNS records

Route 53 is also a domain registrar, it has the ability to check the health of your resources (it is the only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA.

## Route 53 - Records
How you want to route traffic for a domain
Each record contains:
  - Domain/subdomain - e.g. example.com
  - Record type - e.g A or AAAA
  - Value - e.g 12.42.134.13
  - Routing Policy - how route 53 responds to queries
  - TTL (Time-to-live) - Amount of time the record cached at DNS resolvers

Route 53 Supports the following DNS record types:
- Must know - A, AAAA, CNAME, NS
- Advanced but good to know - CAA, DS, MX, NAPTR, PTR, SOA, TXT, SPF, SRV

## Route 53 - Record types
- A - Maps a hostname to ipv4
- AAAA - Maps a hostname to ipv6
- CNAME - Maps a hostname to another hostname
  - the target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
  - Can't create a CNAME record for the top node a DNS namespace (Zone apex)
  - Example: You can't create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com

- NS - Name servers for the hosted zone
  - controls how traffic is routed for a domain

## Route 53 - Hosted zones
A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains. 

- **Public Hosted Zones** - contains records that specify how to route traffic on the internet (public domain names).
application1.mypublicdomain.com

- **Private Hosted Zones** - Contain records that specify how you route traffic with one or more VPCs (private domain names)
application1.company.internal

 $0.5 per month per hosted zone, when registering a domain name you pay at least a minimum of $12 per year

## TTL

High TTL - E.g. 24 hour (most recommended option)
- Less traffic on route 53 ( as it's cache'd on the client)
- Possibly outdated records
_it's recommended if changing DNS records to change the TTL to something low and only do it after the initial ttl has finished (24hr)_

Low TTL - e.g. 60 seconds
- More traffic on Route 53 ($$)
- Records are outdated for less time
- Easy to change records

Except for alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record

## CNAME vs Alias 
AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront... ) expose an AWS hostname:
lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want **myapp.domain.com**

CNAME:
- Point a hostname to any other hostname (app.mydomain.com > example.example.com)
- **ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (app.mydomain.com not mydomain.com)**

Alias:
- Points a hostname to an AWS resource (app.mydomain.com > example.example.com)
- **Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (will work for mydomain.com and app.mydomain.com)**
- Free of charge
- Native healthcheck
- Maps a hostname to an AWS resource (Only for AWS, not DNS usual)
- Automatically recognises changes in resource's IP addresses
- Unlike CNAME, it can be used for the top node of a DNS napespace (zone apex)
- Alias record is always of type A/AAAA for AWS resources
- TTL cannot be set

Cannot set ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name

## Route 53 - Routing Policies

Defines how Route 53 responds to DNS queries, important not to get confused by 'Routing'.
  - It's not the same as Load Balancer routing which routes the traffic
  - DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries

Route 53 supports the follow routing policies
- Simple
- Weighted
- Failover
- Latency based
- Geolocation
- Multi-value answer
- Geoproximity (Using Route 53 traffic flow feature)

## Routing Policy - Simple
Typically, route traffic to a single resource - however can specify multiple values in the same record. If multiple values are returned a random one is chosen by the **client**

<img width="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/946a9be6-b733-4394-b9c5-935e59c040f9">


When ALIAS is enabled, specify only one AWS resource as a target - can't be assoicated with health checks

## Routing Policies - Weighted
Control the % of the requests that go to each specific resource - assign each record a relative weight:

<img width="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/71fb34a7-db9b-45ad-a748-18ba9212647a">

Weights don't need to equate to 100 - they're just indicative how much traffic we want to send to the instances compared to the other records in the DNS name.

DNS records must have the same name (e.g. dev.myapp.com) and type (A, AAAA, SPF, etc) different instances (by ip) - can be associated with health checks

Assigning a weight of 0 to a record to stop sending traffic to a resource, if all recourd have weight of 0, then all records will be returned equally.

**Use case:** load balancing between regions, testing new application versions

## Routing Policies - Latency based
Redirect to the resource that has the least latency close to us - super helpful when latency for users is a priority (this latency based on traffic between users and AWS regions) can be assoicated with health checks. it's just similiar to cloudfront to be honest

## Route 53 - health checks
HTTP health checks are only for **public resources**
