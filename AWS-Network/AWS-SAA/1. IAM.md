# IAM

## IAM Summary
Users: Mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
Groups: Contains users only
Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
Security: MFA + PW Policy
AWS CLI: Manage your AWS services using the command-line
AWS SDK: manage your AWS services using a programming language
Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
Audit: Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor

### IAM Users & Groups

IAM is a global service

Root account is the default account, security best practices is to create an IAM group + user for priv management

Users can be grouped and can be part of multiple groups

Groups only contain users not other groups

Users dont have to be apart of groups

### IAM Hands-on

Is configured in Identity and Access Management (IAM)

You can specify users in Identity Center which is recommended - however there is another option which allows

You then can add them to a group and add a policy to that particular user.

Then you can add tags > e.g adding a user to a department

You can add policies to groups, a lot more easier to manage as they inherit permissions from that group rather than individual perms.

## Permissions

Users or groups can be assigned an IAM policy via a JSON document, it defines permissions for users > make sure to follow least privilege principle.

## IAM Policies indepth

In the screenshot - we can see Alice, Bob, and Charles are apart of the 'Developers' group and therefore will have the assigned policy however Charles is also part of the 'Audit team' so therefore will inherit both group policies. We see Fred is not part of any group but can have their own inline policy

### Policy structure

Consists of:
- the version always will be 2012-10-17
- Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
- Statement: one or more individual statements (required)

Statements consist of:
- Sid: Identifier of statement (Optional)
- Effect: Allow or Deny - self explanatory
- Principal: Accout/user/role to which this policy applies to
- Action: list of actions the policy allows or denies
- Resource: Which AWS resource it applies to
- Condition: Is optional - conditions for when this policy is in effect

### IAM Hands-on
When removing policies from a group, e.g. Admin policy we cannot see the IAM Users as you dont have IAM:ListUsers action.

If we have IAMReadOnlyAccess we can see the users but we cannot create groups.

Admin access would like

"Effect": "Allow",
<br>
"Action": "*"
<br>
"Resource": "*"

### Protecting IAM Users

**IAM, Password Policy**

Stronger passwords = higher security
In AWS you can setup password policies.
- Password length
- Password expiration
- Upper/lower case
- Special characters

**IAM MFA - HIGHLY RECOMMEND**

Adds a second layer of security by combining something you know (password) and something you have (mobile device)
Common-sense stuff.

**IAM Options**
<br>
-Virtual MFA device:
Google Auth: phone-only, Authy: Multi-device

-Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key
YubiKey

- Hardware key Fob MFA Device
Gemalto

Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud

Password policy is in account settings

**How to access AWS?**
<BR>
To access AWS, you have 3 options:
<BR>
- AWS Management console - protected by password + MFA
- AWS CLI: Protected by access keys
- AWS Sofware Development Kit (SDK) - For code: protected by access keys

Access keys are generated through the AWS Console
Access keys are secret, Access key ID similar to username - Secret Access Key similar to password


**AWS CLI**

AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) > direct access to the public APIs of AWS services, can be used to develop scripts to manage your resources.

Requires installation of the CLI on endpoint, e.g. For windows install msi (for mac use .pkg file) and run wizard. Once on windows open cmd prompt and type > aws.

For linux curl the zip file from aws and unzip and sudo ./aws/install

**Access keys**
<BR>
Access keys are needed to use CLI, therefore go to 'Security credentials' and then > 'Access keys'. 

**AWS SDK**
<BR>
Enables you access and manage AWS services programtically, not CLI based it's embedded with your app. Supports mnany coding languages.

**CloudShell**
<BR>
Has some regions that aren't supported - Cloudshell is simply a CLI from a sandbox terminal inside AWS

### IAM Roles for Services
Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf.

To do so, we will assign **permissions** to AWS Services with **IAM Roles**

Common roles:
EC2 Instance Roles
Lambda Function Roles
Roles for CloudFormation

### IAM Security Tools
- IAM Credentials Report ( Account-level )
A report that lists all your accounts users and the status of their credentials
<img width="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/cc0261d5-03f4-4cf3-bb7a-e3da917ca0d7">


- IAM Access Advisor ( Account-level )
Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. You can use this to revise your policies
<img width="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/74666714-5f9b-4cee-83dd-514316d3cd0b">


(Both can be found inside IAM, Left hand side > near the bottom).

### IAM Best Practices
- Don't use root, only use to create accounts at start
- One physical user = One AWS user (dont share creds)
- Strong password policy and MFA
- Assigned users to groups and assign perms to groups
- Create and use roles for giving perms to AWS services
- Use access keys for Programmatic Access ( cli / sdk )
- Audit Perms of your account use IAM credentials report and IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users and Access keys
