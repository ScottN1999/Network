# CloudWatch

Provides metrics for every services in AWS > metrics variables to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)

Metrics belong to **namespaces** 

**Dimensions** is an attribute of a metric, example could be CPU util > instance id, environment, etc ...

Up to 30 dimensions per metric > metrics have **timestamps**

Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics - can create **CloudWatch Custom Metrics** (for the RAM for example)


##  CloudWatch Metric Streams

Continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice, with **near-real-time delivery** and low latency.
  - Kinesis Data Firehose (and then its destinations)
  - 3rd party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Splunk, Sumo Logic

Option to **filter metrics** to only stream a subset of them

# CloudWatch Logs

**Log groups:** Arbitrary name, usually representing an application

**Log stream:** instances with application / log files / containers

Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 1 day to 10 years)

Can send them to:
  - S3
  - Kinesis Data Streams
  - Kinesis Data Firehose
  - AWS Lambda
  - OpenSearch

Logs are encrypted by default - can setup KMS-based encryption with your own keys.

## CloudWatch logs - Sources

- SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent
- Elastic Beanstalk collection of logs from application
- ECS: Collection from function logs
- VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs
- API Gateway
- CloudTrail based on filter
- Route53: Log DNS queries

## CloudWatch Logs - Insights

Can be used for querying logs in visualisation and view log lines.

## CloudWatch Logs - S3 Export 

Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export > the API call is **CreateExportTask**. Not near-real time or real-time .. use Logs Subscriptions instead.

## CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions

Get a real-time log events from CloudWatch logs for processing and analysis - can be sent to Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, or Lambda.

**Subscription filter** - filter which logs are events delivered to your destination


# CloudWatch logs for EC2

By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch, you need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want - ensure to make sure IAM permissions are correctly configured.

The CloudWatch log agent can be setup onprem too.

**2 different agents**

**CloudWatch Logs Agent**
  - Old agent
  - Can only send to CloudWatch logs

**CloudWatch Unified Agent**
  - Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc ..
  - Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
  - Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store

# CloudWatch Alarms

Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric.

Alarm States:
  - OK
  - INSUFFICIENT_DATA
  - ALARM

Period:
  - Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric
  - High resolution custom metrics: 10 sec, 30 sec or multiples of 60s

## CloudWatch Alarm Targets

- Stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an EC2
- Trigger Auto scaling action
- Send notification to SNS (from which you can do pretty much anything)

## CloudWatch Alarms - Composite Alarms

CloudWatch alarms are on a single metric, **composite alarm are monitoring the states of multiple other alarms** > this is used by AND and OR conditions.

This is helpful to reduce 'alarm noise' by creating complex composite alarms.

# Amazon EventBridge (used to be CloudWatch Events)

Schedule Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)

Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something

Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages ...

# AWS CloudTrail

Provides **governance, compliance and audit for your AWS account**

CloudTrail is enabled by default!

Get a history of events / API calls made within your AWS account by:
  - Console
  - SDK
  - CLI
  - AWS Services

Can put logs from CloudTrail into Cloudwatch Logs or S3.

**A trail can be applied to All regions (default) or a single region**.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/7c8e3e37-d46d-46b8-89b6-a599c958259c)

## CloudTrail Events

**Management Events:**
  - Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
  - Examples:
      - Configure security (IAM **AttachRolePolicy**)
      - Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 **CreateSubnet**)
      - Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail **CreateTrail**)
  - **By default, trails are configured to log management events.**
  - Can seperate **Read events** (that's dont modify resources) from **Write Events**

**Data Events:**
  - **By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)**
  - S3 Object-level activity (ex: **GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject)** can seperate read and write events.
  - AWS Lambda function execution activity (the **Invoke** API)

**CloudTrail Insights Events**
Enable CloudTrails Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
  - Inaccuraye resource provisioning
  - Hitting service limits
  - Burst of AWS IAM actions
  - Gaps in periodic maintenance activity

CloudTrail Insights analyses normal management events to create a baseline, and then **continously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns**
  - Anomalies appear in the CloudTrails console
  - Event is sent to S3
  - An EventBridge even is generated (for automation needs)

## CloudTrails Events Retention

Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail, to keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena.

# AWS Config

Helps with auditing and recording **compliance** of your AWS resources

Helps record configurations and changes over time

**Questions that can be solved by Config**
  - Is there unrestricted SSH access to my NSGs
  - Do my buckets have any public access?
  - How has my ALB config chanegd over time?

You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes, AWS config is a per-region service > but can be aggregated across regions and accounts.

Possibility of storing into s3 > athena analysis.

# CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config

**CloudWatch**
  - Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network) and dashboards
  - Events and alerting
  - Log aggregation and analysis

**CloudTrail**
  - Record API calls made within your Account by everyone
  - Can define trails for specific resources
  - Global service

**Config**
  - Record configuration changes
  - Evaluate resources against compliance rules
  - Get timeline of changes and compliance
