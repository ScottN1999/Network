## Amazon S3
S3 is the main building blocks of AWS, it's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage. Many websites use S3 as a backbone - many AWS services use S3 as an integration as well.

**Use case of S3**
- Backup and storage
- DR
- Archiving files
- Hybrid cloud storage (on prem + cloud)
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

Nasdaq stores 7 yrs of data into S3 glacier

## Buckets

S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories), buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts). S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
Naming convention:
- No uppercase, no underscore
- 3-63 char long
- Not and IP
- Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Must NOT start with prefix xn--
- Must NOT end with the suff -s3alias

## Objects
Objects (files) have a Key. The **KEY** is the **_FULL_** path:
- s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt** (for nested folders)

The key is composed of **prefix** + _object name_
- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder/another_folder/**_my_file.txt_

There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise). There is just keys with very long names that contain slashes.

## Objects cont.

- Object value are the content of the body:
  - Max object size is 5tb
  - If uploading more than 5gb, must use "multi-part upload"

- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## S3 Security
- User-based
  - IAM Policies - which API calls should be allows for specific user from IAM

- Resource-based
  - Buck Policies (most common) - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control list (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be diabled)

 Note: an IAM principal can access and S3 object if
  - The user IAM permissions **ALLOW** it OR the resource policy **ALLOWS** it
  - **AND** there's no explicit DENY

Encryption: Encrypt objects in S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Bucket Policies
JSON based policy:
- Resources: buckets and objects
- Effect: Allow/Deny
- Actions: Set of API to allow or deny
- Principal: the account or user to apply the policy to

<img width="183" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/b0077ba8-5bd8-43a8-8a1c-5502ff5bccde">

Use S3 Bucket for policy to:
- Grant public access to the bucket (as shown above)
- Force objecys to be encrypted at upload
- Grant access to another account (cross account)

Bucket setting for block public access - these setting were created to prevent data leaks, if S3 bucket isn't meant to be public leave it on.

## How S3 can be make static websites

The URL depends on the region:
e.g. http://**bucket-name**.s3-wesbite.**aws-region**.amazonaws.com

Notes: if a 403 forbidden error comes up, the bucket policy isn't allowing public reads then.

## S3 - Versioning
You can version your files in S3, it is enabled at the **bucket level**. Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1,2,3 ...

- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version
 
- Notes:
    - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
    - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## S3 Replication (CRR  and SRR (Cross-region replication and same region replication).

Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets, buckets can be in different AWS accounts. The copying is asynchronous between the buckets - the replication is done in the background. Must give proper IAM perms to S3.

<img width="399" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/11059b1c-027b-4770-b461-fe24ba59e190">


After you enable Replication, only new objects are replicated.
Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using **S3 Batch Replication**
  - Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication

For DELETE operations
  - **can replicate delete markers** from source to target (optional setting)
  - Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)

There is no "chaining" of replication - If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3 then objects create in bucket 1 are not replicate to bucket 3.

- Use cases:
  - CRR: Compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - SRR: Log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

## S3 Storage Classes
- s3 Standard - General Purpose
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
- S3 Glaicer Instant Retrieval
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- S3 Intillegient Tiering

- Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

## S3 Durability and Availability
Durability:
Highly durable (99.99% , 11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ, if you store 10,000,000 objects with S3, you can average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years (This is across all storage classes)

Available:
- Measures how readily available a service is - this varies in S3 on the storage class (example S3 standards has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year.

## S3 Standard - General Purpose
99.99% Available, it is used for frequently access data - low latency and high throughput (can sustrain 2 concurrent facility failures)

Use cases: Big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution, ...

## S3 Infrequent Access
For data is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed **lower cost than S3 standard**.

- **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)**
  - 99.9% Availability (a little less than general purpose being 99.99)
  - Use cases: Disaster recover, backups

- **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)**
  - High durability (99.99999999%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is dead
  - 99.5% Available
  - Use case: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

## S3 Glacier Storage Classes
Low-cost object sotrage meanth for archiving/backup
Pricing: Price for storage + object retrieval cost

- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**
  - Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days

- **S3 Glaicer Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier)**

- Frequent access tier (automatic): default tier
- Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive instant access tier (automatic): Objects not accessed for 90 days
- Archive access tier (optional): Configurable for 90 days to 700+ days
- Deep archive access tier (optional): Config, from 180 days to 700+ days
