**VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM**

## Stateless app (in this example just telling the time)

<img width="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/e22d7a3a-4106-495b-b683-e8e395930e35">

- Understanding Public vs Private IP and EC2 instances
- Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load balancers
- Route 53 TTL, A records and Alias recourds
- Maintaining EC2 instance manually vs ASG
- Multi-az to survive disasters
- ELB health checks
- Security group rules
- Reservation of capacity for cost savings
- We're considering 5 pillars for a well architected application:
  - Costs (reservation of EC2s rather than on-demand pricing, ASG to ensure we only use EC2s on what we need)
  - Performance (Vertical scaling, ELBs and ASGs)
  - Reliability (Multi AZ, and route 53)
  - Security (Security groups for ELBs and EC2 comms)
  - Operational excellence (fixing the 1 t2 micro being overloaded)

If you reserve the min cap to 0, that's very epic.

## Stateful App (in this example a shopping cart, and user details in DB)

The problem:

<img width="351" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/53759fe8-9ad5-43aa-a26b-544494b9d983">

Updated the shopping cart and that traffic goes to a different instance, resulting in the shopping cart being lost - refreshes and causes more issues.

To fix:
ELB stickiness (session affinity)

But what if the ec2 dies? we lose our session. **Solution** User cookies, regardless of which EC2 it talks to, because the user tells the EC2 what's in it.

The solution is stateless, however the HTTP requests becom heavier, there is security risks (cookies can be altered), cookies must be validated and must be less than 4kb (so we're limited)

**What next?**

Server sessions:

* Could also use DynamoDB

More secure as attackers can't modiy cookies now.

## For database

Scaled instances can read from the read replicas rather than always hitting the RDS master we could also use lazy loading with ElastiCache

## Lets add HA for durability

- Add Multi AZ for RDS, and ElastiCache Redis Multi AZ

## For security

<img width="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/3e30edf5-a9f7-4767-b9bd-35c672cad826">

- The ELB will allow 80 and 443 for any IP
- However we will restrict traffic on the private instances, therefore public traffic to EC2, and traffic from the EC2 to the ElastiCache or RDS

**Key points**
- ELB sticky sessions for when the user was getting their cart fked
- Web clients for storing cookies and making the web app stateless (regardless of where the ELB takes them)
- - ElastiCache
    - For storing sessions (can also use DynamoDB)
    - For caching data from RDS
    - Multi AZ with Redis not Memcached
  - RDS
    - Storing user data
    - Read replicas for scaling reads
    - Multi AZ for durability
  
  Tightened security with NSGs referencing each other

## Creating WordPress website with image uploading

Has an RDS MySQL instance, we replaced with Aurora MySQL for multi AZ and read replicas because Aurora has fancy features and scales better.

We have 1 EC2 instance with an EBS volume, the image is stored on EBS and happy days and the user can read from the EBS volume. However when we scale with EBS - if the image is stored on 1 EBS volume what happens if the ELB sends you to a different instance? The picture aint there.

We can fix this with EFS, as it creates ENI on each AZ - now we have a central location as it can access different AZs (very common procedure irl)

**Key takeways**
- Auorora DB to have easy Multi-AZ and read replicas
- Storing data in EBS is great for single instance application
- However storing data in EFS is much better for distributed apps
- EBS is cheaper than EFS

## Instantiating Applications quickly
Obviously setting everything up manually is a pain so what can we do?

EC2s:
- Golden AMI: Install your app, OS dependencies etc... beforehand and luanch your future EC2s from the Golden AMI
- Bootstrap using User Data: For dynamic config, user data scripts
- Hybrid: Mix Golden AMI and user data (Beanstalk)

RDS:
- Restore from a snapshot: the DB will have schemas and data ready

EBS
- Restore from a snapshot: the disk will already be formatted and have data

## Elastic Beanstalk

Dev problems
- Managing infra
- Deploying code
- Configuring all the dbs, ELBS, etc
- Scaling concerns

- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)

## Overview

Elastic Beanstalk is a dev centric view of deploying an application on AWS

Managed service
  - Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, instance config, ...
  - Just the app code is the responsibility of the dev

We have full control over the config - Beanstalk is free but you pay for the instances that are created.

## Componenets
**Application**: collection of Elastic Beanstalk componenets (environments, versions, configs, ...)
**Application version**: an iteration of the app code
**Environment**:
  - Collection of AWS resources running an app version (only 1 app version at a time)
  - Tiers: Web server environment tier and worker environment tier
  - You can create multiple environments (dev,test,prod,...)

## Web Server Tier vs Worker Tier


<img width="421" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/f7290c4c-f1f8-40ec-afc6-9e8ff9b7b480">

Worker env:
Scale based on the number of SQS messages
Can push messages to SQS queue from another Web Server Tier
