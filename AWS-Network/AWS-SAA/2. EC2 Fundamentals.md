## Elastic Compute Cloud

EC2 is one the most popular AWS' offering, is a VM > IaaS

Has the capability of:
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

### EC2 Sizing and config options
- Operating system: Linux, Windows or Mac
- How much computer power and cores (CPU)
- How much memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
    - Network-attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
- Network card: speed of the card, public IP
- Firewall rules: Network security groups (NSG)
- Bootstrap script (config at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script, bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts. That script is only run once at the instance first start.

EC2 User data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading common files from the internet
- anything you can think of

T2.micro is parth of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

### EC2 Instance Types

Example: m5.2xlarge <br>
m = instance class <br>
5 = generation (AWS improves them over time) <br>
2xlarge = size within the instance class <br>

Use case:
- High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP) systems
- Relational & NoSQL databases
- Cache for in-memory databases (e.g. Redis)
- Data warehousing applications
- Distributed file systems

### Network Security Groups

Security groups are fundamental network security - controls traffic of our EC2 instances.

Security groups only contain **allow rules**, security group rules can reference by IP or by security group.

<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/58e5a86f-143d-475f-a3fa-1db24ab2bb86">

They regulated:
- Access to ports
- Authorise IP ranged - IPv4 and IPv6
- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

<img width="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/00f910e6-fc24-4596-9ba0-f5908e12bff4">

### NSG good to knows
Can be attached to multiple instances, they are locked down to a region / VPC combination. Does live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 won't see it. It's good to maintain one seperate NSG for SSH access, note if your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a NSG issue however if connections refused error then its an application issue.

<img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/7e5a23ca-ba08-4b78-8aa4-c4a48c4c8405">


- All inbound traffic is **blocked** by default
- All outbound traffic is **allowed** by default

<img width="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1c760e85-6520-4c8b-8d0f-2a375cef7dc3">

If one VM has a shared NSG, they can communicate with one another and you don't have to worry about IPs as much - in the screenshot you can see the third VM fails.

**Ports to know**
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into instance
- 21 = FTP (File transfer) - Upload files into file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure FTP) - Upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - Unencrypted HTTP
- 443 = HTTPS - Encrypted
- 3389 = RDP (Remote desktop protocol) - Remoting into windows pc

**Connecting to VMs**

<img width="379" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/b895cb3c-b36a-45b3-8f72-66b4f6708835">


Never enter IAM access key into an EC2, anyone that connects to said EC2 will be able to view your access key, this is where we use IAM roles.

<img width="302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/3b983bf9-15c8-472b-a1b0-b6dff778fcb3">

To create an IAM role:

Now we can run the following command, this is gained from the policy attached that particular IAM role if we were to remove this policy from the IAM role then they wouldn't be able to run the command.

### EC2 Instance Purchase Options

**On-demand Instances**
Short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second

**Reserved (1 & 3 years)**
- Reserved instances - long workloads
- Convertible Reserved instances - long workload with flexible instances

**Saving plans (1 & 3 years)**
Commitemnt to an amount of usage, long workload

**Spot instances**
Short workloads, is cheapest, can lose instances (less reliable)

**Dedicated hosts**
Book an entire physical server, control instance placement

**Dedicated instances**
No other customers will share your hardware

**Capacity reservations**
Reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

## EC2 On Demand

Pay for what you use.
- Windows or linux, billed per second, after the first minute
- All other OS - per hour

Highest cost but no upfront payment
No long-term commitment

- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where yo ucan't predict how the application will behave.


## EC2 Reserved Instances

<img width="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/4334cfee-39a3-405e-a167-033f7ab3f57d">

<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/a54e578c-2118-4d97-ab12-1c4d373b180c">


Up to 72% discount compared to on-demand

You reserve a specific instance attribute (Instance type, region, tenance, OS)

Reservation Period - 1 year (+ discount) or 3 years (+++ discount)

Payment options - No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All upfront (+++)

Reserved instance's scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)

Recommended for Steady-state usage applications (e.g. a database)

You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace

Convertible Reserved Instance
- Can change the EC2 instance type, family, OS, scope, and tenancy
- Up to 66% discount


## EC2 Savings Plans
Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as reserved instances)

**BUT** coomit to a certain type of usage ($10 and hour for 1 or 3 years), usage beyond EC2 savings plans is billed at the on-demand price.

Locked to a specific instance family & region.

## Spot instances

Best discount, up to 90% compared to on-demand. However instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less that the current spot price. **Most cost efficient option**

<img width="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/7bcaf9c6-38d5-4607-b0fa-c4b9f6db2f6a">


Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
- Batch jobs
- Data analysis
- Image processing
- Any distributed workloads
- Workloads with a flexible start and end time

Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

Define max spot price and get the instance while **current spot price < max** the hourly rate spot price varies based on offer and capacity, if the current spot > your max price you choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 minutes grace period.

Other strategy: **Spot block**
*No longer used*, "block" spot instance during a specific time period (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions - in rare situations, the instance may be reclaimed.

<img width="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/e2803ba9-b5c1-49ec-a258-49118489d849">

**Spot fleets**
Set of spot instances + (optional) On-demand Instances

The spot fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
- Define possible launch pools: instance type, OS, AZ
- Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
- Spot fleets stop launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost

Strategies to allocate spot instances:
- lowestPrice: From the pool with the lowest price (cost optimisation, short workload)
- Diversified: Distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
- CapacityOptimised: Pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
- PriceCapavityOptimised (recommended): Pools with the highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for worloads)

Spot fleets allows us to automatically request spot instances with the lowest price.

## EC2 Dedicated Hosts
A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated your use.

Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses).

Purchasing Options:
- On-demand - pay per second for active dedicated host
- Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No upfront, partial, full)

Most expensive option, useful for software that have complicated licensing models (BYOL - Bring your own license) or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs.

## EC2 Dedicated Instances

Instances run on harfware that's dedicated to you, may share hardware with other instances in same account. No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start)

<img width="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/eb8714e3-e7ec-4071-a9e5-8ed772b1cfd3">

## EC2 Capacity Reservations 

Reserve On-demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration, you can always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it.

No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), **no billing discounts**, combine with regional reserved instance and saving plans to benefit from billing discounts. You're charged On-demand rate whether you run instances or not.


Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ.
