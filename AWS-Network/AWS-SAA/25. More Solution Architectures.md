# Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale Section

## AWS CloudFormation

Is a decltrative way of outlining your AWS infra, for any resource

For example within a CloudFormation template you say:
  - I want a NSG
  - I want two EC2 using the NSG
  - I want S3
  - I want ELB

Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact config that you specify.

## Benefit of CloudFormation

**Infrastructure as code**
  - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
  - Changes to the infra are reviewed through code

**Cost**
  - Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
  - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
  - Savings strategy: In dev, you could automate deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM

**Productivity**
  - Lots faster
  - Autoamted generation of diagram
  - Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering or orchestration)

**Don't reinvent the wheel**
  - Leverage existing templates on the web
  - Leverage the documentation

**Supports (almost) all AWS resources**
  - You can use "custom resources" for resources not supported

## CloudFormation + Application Composer

We can see all the resources and how it's linked.

## CloudFormation - Service Role

IAM role that allows CloudFormation to create/update/delete stack resources on your behalf - give ability to create/update/delete the stack resources even if they don't have permissions to work with the resources in the stack

Use cases:
  - Achieve principle of least privilege
  - but you dont want the give the user all the required perms to create the stack resources

User must have **iam:PassRole** permissions

# SES (Simple Email Services)

Fully managed service to send emails securely, globally at scale - allows inbound/outbound emails

Reputation dashboard, performance insights, anti-spam feedback

Provides statistics such as email deliveries, bounces, feedback loop result, email open.

Support SPF and DKIM.

Flexible IP deployment: shared, dedicated, and customer-owned IPs - send emails using your application using AWS console, APIs, or SMTP

Use cases: transactional, marketing and bulk email, communications

# Pinpoint

Scalable **2-way (outbound/inbound)** marketing communications service. Supports email, SMS, push, vouce, and in-app messaging. Ability to segment and personalize messages with the right content to customers.

Possibility to receive replies - scales to billions of messages per day

**Use case:** run campaigns by sending marketing, bulk, transactional SMS messages

**Versus SNS or SES**
  - In SNS and SES you managed each message's audience, content, and delivery schedule.
  - In AWS Pinpoint, you create message templates, delivery schedules, highly-targeted segments, and full campaigns

# Systems Manager - SSM Session Manager

Allows you start a secure shell on your EC2 and onprem servers

- **No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed**
- **No port 22 needed (better security)**
- Supports all OS
- Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch Logs

# Systems Manager - Run Command

Execute a document (= script) or just run a command, run command across multiple instances (using resource groups)

- No need for SSH

Command Output can be shown in the AWS console, sent to S3 bucket or CloudWatch logs

Send notifications to SNS about command status (In progress, Success, Failed, ...)

Integrated with IAM and CloudTrail

Can be ivoked using EventBridge

## Systems Manager - Patch Manager

Automates the process of patching managed instances.

OS updates, application updates, security updates > support EC2 and onprem servers

Patch on-demand or on a schedule using **Maintenance Windows**

Scan instances and generate patch compliance report (missing patches)

## System Manager - Maintenance Windows

Define a schedule for when to perform actions on your instances - example: OS patching, updating drivers, installing software

## Systems Manager - Automation

Simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of EC2 and other resources.

Examples: restart instances, creat an AMI, EBS snapshot

**Automation Runbook -** SSM Documents to define actions performed on your EC2 instances or AWS resources (pre-defined or custom)

Can be triggered using:
  - Manually using AWS Console, CLI, or SDK
  - EventBridge
  - On a schedule using Maintenance windows
  - By AWS Config for rules remediations

# AWS Cost Explorer

Visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time - create custom reports that analyse cost and usage data.

Analyse your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts

Choose an optimal **Savings Plan**

**Forecast usage up to 12 month based on previous usage**

# AWS Cost Anomaly Detection

**Continously monitor your cost and usage using ML to detect unusual spends**

It learns your unique, historing spend patterns to detect one-time cost spike.

Can get notified with individual alerts using SNS

# AWS Batch

Fully managed batch processing at **any scale**

Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS > a "batch" job is a start and an end (opposed to continous)

Batch will dynamically launch **EC2 instance or spot instances**

AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory.

You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS batch does the rest.

Batch jobs are defined as **Docker images** and **run on ECS**

Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure.


# Amazon AppFlow

Fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications and AWS**

**Sources:** Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, and SNOW

**Destinations:** AWS services like **S3, Redshift** or non-AWS such as SnowFlake and Salesforce

**Frequency:** on a schedule, in response to event, or on demand

**Data transformation** capabilities like filtering and validation

**Encrypted** over the public internet or privately over AWS PrivateLink

Don't spend time writing integrations and leverage APIs immediately.
