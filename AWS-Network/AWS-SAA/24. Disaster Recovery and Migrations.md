# Disaster Recovery 

- RPO: Recovery Point Objective
- RTO: Recovery Time Objective

RPO = The point of where you choose to have a point of restore

RTO = When you recover - the downtime

The smaller you want these gaps is gonna depend how much you want to pay.


## DR Strategies

- Backup and restore
- Pilot light
- Warm standby
- Hot site / Multi site approach

## Backup and Restore ( High RPO )

- Cheap and easy
- High RPO and RTO

## Pilot Light

- A samll version of the app is always running in the cloud
- Useful for critical core (pilot light)
- Very similar to backup and restore
- Faster than backup and restore as critical systems are already up

## Warm standby

- Full system is up and running, but at minimum size
- Upon disaster we can scale to production load
- More costly because stuff is running but less RTO and RPO

## Multi Site / Hotsite approach

- Very low RTO - very expensive
- Full production scale is running AWS and on prem (active-active setup)

## DR in AWS

- **Backup**
  - EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / snapshots, etc...
  - Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication
  - From onprem: Snowball or storage gateway
 
- **High Availability**
  - Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region
  - Multi AZ (RDS, Elasticache, EFS, S3)
  - Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect
 
- **Replication**
  - RDS (Cross region), Aurora + Global DBs
  - Database replication from onprem to RDS
  - Storage gateway
 
- **Automation**
  - CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment
  - Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail
  - AWS Lambda functions for customized automations
 
- **Chaos**
  - Netflix has a "simian-army" randomly terminating EC2 (testing)
 
# DMS - Database Migration Service

Quickly and securely migrate DBs to AWS, resilient, self healing - the source DB remains available during the migration.

Continous Data Replication using CDC - you must create an EC2 to perform the replication tasks.

## DMS Sources Targets

**Sources:**
- Onprem and EC2 instance DBs: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, Postgre, Mongo, SAP, DB2
- Azure SQL DB
- RDS
- S3
- DocumentDB

**Targets:**
- Onprem and EC2 instances dbs
- RDS
- RedShift, DynamoDB, S3
- OpenSearch Service
- Kinesis Data Streams
- Apache Kafka
- DocumentDB and Neptune
- Redis and Babelfish

## AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

This converts your DB's Schema from one engine to another.

Example OLTP: (SQL Server or Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
Example OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to RedShift

**You don't always need SCT - if they have the same engine it's not needed**


## RDS and Aurora MySQL Migrations (specifically for MySQL)

**RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL:**
  - Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS MySQL restored as MySQL Aurora DB
  - Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS MySQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost $)

**External MySQL to Aurora MySQL**
  - Option 1:
    - Use Percona XtraBackup to create a file backup in S3
    - Create an Aurora MySQL DB from S3
  - Options 2:
    - Create an Aurora MySQL DB
    - Use the MySQLDump utility to migrate MySQL into Aurora (slower than S3 method)
   
**Use DMS if both DBs are up and running**

**This is the same for DynamoDB**
