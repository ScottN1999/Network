# ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## EC2 Launch type

Launch docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters.

EC2 Launch Type: you must provision and maitain the infra (the EC2 instance) > each EC2 must run the ECS Agent to register the ECS Cluster > Once done AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers.

## Fargate Launch Type

You do not provision the infra (No EC2 to manage) > it's serverless

You create task definitions - AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need. To scale, just increase the number of tasks, pretty simple - no more EC2s

## IAM Roles for ECS

**EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only):**
  - Used by the **ECS Agent**
  - Makes API calls to ECS service
  - Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
  - Pull Docker image from ECR
  - Reference senstive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store

**ECS Task Role:**
  - Allows each task to have a specific role
  - Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
  - Task Role is defined in the **task definition**

## Load Balancer Integrations

**ALB:** Supported and works for the most use cases

**NLB:** Recommended only for throughput / high performance use cases, or to pair it with AWS private link

**CLB:** Supported but not recommended (no advanced features - no Fargate)

## ECS Auto Scaling

Automatically increase or decreade the number of ECS Tasks

ECS Auto scaling uses **AWS Application Auto Scaling**
  - ECS Service avg CPU Util
  - ECS Servcie avg RAM util
  - ALB Request Count Per Target - metric coming from the ALB


**Target Tracking -** Scale based on target value for specific CloudWatch metric

**Step Scaling -** Scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm

**Scheduled Scaling -** Scaled based on a specific date/time (predictable changes)

ECS Autoscaling (task level) != EC2 Autoscaling (EC2 level)

Fargate Auto Scaling is much easier to setup (**because it's serverless**)


## ECS Auto Scaling - Scaling EC2s

Accommodates ECS Service Scaling by adding underlying EC2s

**ASG Scaling**
  - Scale your ASG based on CPU util
  - Add EC2s over time

**ECS Cluster Capacity Provider - Recommended**
  - Used to automatically provision and scale the infra for your ECS Tasks
  - Capacity Provider paired with an ASG
  - Add EC2s when you're missing capacity (CPU, RAM, etc)

Now able to save images and upload it from S3 thanks to IAM role.


## ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

We have been talking about Docker Hub > but AWS has it's service where we can store manage docker images on AWS - this being ECR.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/efe5a510-d78b-4335-92e5-9395aed0bce3)


Has a private and public repo (ECR public lib: https://gallery.ecr.aws)

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/cee9e920-3077-4408-b468-8da18ae30f8b)

Fully integrated with ECS, backed by S3 > stored there.

AcceSs is controlled through IAM.

## EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

It Is a way to launch **managed kubernetes clusters on AWS**. K8 is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized (usually Docker) application > it's an alternatic to ECS, similar goal but different APIs.

EKS supports both deploy modes (EC2 or Fargate)

Use cases: If your company is already using k8 onprem or is in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using K8.

**It's cloud-agnostic, can be used in any public cloud**

## AWS App Runner

Fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web apps and APIs at scale - no infrastructure experience required.

Start with your source code or container image

Automatically builds and deploy the web app

Automatic scaling, highly available, load balancer, encryption - VPC access to support
