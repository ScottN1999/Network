# Decoupling

When we start deploying mulitple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another - there are two patterns of application communication:

1. Synchronous communications (application to application)

Between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic - we to **decouple applications**

2. Asynchronous / Event based (applications to queue to application)

## Decoupling

We can decouple with the help of:
- Using SQS - Queue model
- SNS - Pub/sub model
- Kinesis - real-time streaming model

## SQS 

- One of the oldest services (over 10 years old)

Fully managed service, used to **decouple applications**

Attributes:
- Unlimited througput, unlimited number of messages in queue
- Default retention of messages: 4 days, max of 14d
- Low latency (<10 ms on public and receive)
- Limitation of 256kb per message sent

Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)

Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)

Producers will send to SQS using SDK (SendMessage API)
This message is **persisted** in SQS until a consumer deletes it 

Example: Send an order to be processed
- Order ID
- Customer ID
- Any attributes you want

SQS Standard: unlimited througput

## Consuming messages
Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or Lamda), consumer polls SQS for messages (receive up to 10 messages at a time). Process the messages (example: insert the message into an RDS database), once the message has been consumed an API is called 'DeleteMessage'.

There can be more than one consumers at a time > consumers recieve and process messages in parallel. At least once delivery is used so if for whatever reason a consumer is taking too long processing another consumer can do it > also why we have best-effore message ordering. We can horizontally to improve throughput of processing (good for ASGs)

**Scaling front-end and back-end accordingly with decoupling applications:** 
e.g. Using compute-optimised for video encoding somewhere and storage-optimised somewhere else

## SQS - Security
**Encryption:**
  - In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
  - At-rest encryption using KMS keys
  - Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encrypt/decrypt itself

**Access Controls:** IAM policies to regulate access to the SQS API

**SQS Access Policies** (similar to S3 bucket policies)
  - Useful for cross-account access to SQS queues
  - Useful for allowing other services (SNS, S3) to write to an SQS queue.

## SQS - Message Visibility Timeout

Basically after a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers - by default this is 30s. That means the message has 30s to be processed, however if this doesnt happen in time the message becomes visible again.

If we don't process within the visbility timeout, it will be processed **twice** > however the consumer could call the **ChangeMessageVisbility** API to get more time so it won't get processed twice.

If visbility is high (hours), and consumer crashes, re-processing will take time - however if it's too low, we may get duplicates (you need to find a good time per application).

## SQS - Long polling

Is when a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally "wait" for messages to arive if there are none in the queue - basically spawn camping it.

**LongPolling decreases the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and latency of your application**.

The wait time can be between 1-20s (20s being more preferable) because long polling is preferable to short polling > Long polling can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using **WaitTimeSeconds**

**When we see on the exam mentioning minimising the amount API calls and latency we do to SQS queues > think long polling**

## SQS - FIFO Queue (First in first out)

- Exactly how it sounds, go back to hospitality days > we want old products out first.

- Limited throughput: 300msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with

- Exactly-once send capability (by removing duplicated) > messages are processed in order by the consumer

**We worry about FIFO for order for the exam, but remember negatives on limited throughput**

# SNS 

What happens if you want to send one messages to many receivers?

A direct integration is ok, but a bit operational overhead heavy in the sense on whenever something new comes along you have to create an integration between the services. 

With a publish / subscribe model using SNS > It's a lot easier so the services can subscribe to a SNS topic.


The "event producer" only sends message to one SNS topic - as many "event receivers" (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications. Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filter messages).

Up to 12.5 million subscriptions per topic > 100,000 topics limit.

Many, many AWS services can send data directly to SNS for notifications

## How to publish?

Topic publish (Using the SDK)
  - Create a topic
  - Create a subscription (or many)
  - Publish to the topic

Direct publish (for mobile apps SDK)
  - Create a platform application
  - Create a platform endpoint
  - Publish to the platform endpoint
  - Works with Google GCM, Appls APDNS, Amazon ADM (different ways your device receives notifications)


## SNS Security
**Encryption:**
  - In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
  - At-rest encryption using KMS keys
  - Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encrypt/decrypt itself


**Access Controls:** IAM policies to regulate access to the SQS API

**SNS Access Policies** (similar to S3 bucket policies)
  - Useful for cross-account access to SNS topics
  - Useful for allowing other services (S3) to write to an SNS topic.


## SNS + SQS: Fan Out

Push once in SNS, receive in all SQS that are subscribers > fully decoupled, no data loss.

SQS allows for : data persistence, delayed processing and retries of work, bbility to add more SQS subscribers over time.

Make sure your SQS queue **access policy** allows for SNS to write

Cross-region delivery: Works with SQS Queues in other regions


## AWS Kinesis

Makes it easy to **collect, process and analyse** streaming data in real-time. Ingest real-time data such as: Application logs, Metrics, Website clickstreams, IoT telemtry data

**Kinesis Data Streams:** Capture, process, and store data streams
**Kinesis Data Firehouse:** Load data streams into AWS data stores
**Kinesis Data Analytics:** Analyse data streams with SQL or Apache Flink
**Kinesis Video Streams:** Capture, process, and store video streams

## Kinesis Data Streams

A way of streaming big data in our systems > it's made of multiple shards.

Retention between 1 - 365 days > ability to reprocess (replay) data
