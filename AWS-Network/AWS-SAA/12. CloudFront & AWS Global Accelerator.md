# CloudFront

A content delivery network (CDN), it improves read performance, content is caches at the edge (improves user experience)

216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)

With it having so many edge locations it comes with DDoS protection (because it's world wide) Integration with Shield, AWS WAF

## s3 Origins

- S3 Bucket
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhances security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
  - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
 
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - ALB
  - EC2
  - S3 Website (must first enable to bucket as a static S3 website)
  - Any HTTP backend you want

## CloudFront at a high level

## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

CloudFront:

- Global Edge network
- Files are cache for a TTL (maybe a day)
- Great for static content that must be available everywhere

S3 Cross Region Replication
- Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
- Files are updated in near real time
- Read only
- Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

## CloudFront - ALB or EC2 as an origin

**Price Classes**

You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction

3 classes:
- Price Class All: all regions - best performance
- Price Class 200: Most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
- Price Class 100: Only the least expensive regions

## CloudFront - Cache Invalidations

In case you update back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired.

However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a **CloudFront Invalidation**. You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)
