# AWS Lambda

Easy pricing 
- Pay per request and compute time
- Free tier of 1 million Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time

It is integrated with the whole suite of AWS services - as well with many programming languages.

Easy monitoring through CloudWatch - easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM), increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

## Lambda Limits 

**Per-region**

**Execution**

- Memory allocation : 128 MB - 10GB (1 MB increments)
- Maximum execution time: 15 minutes
- Environment variables: 4kb
- Disk cap in the "function container" (in /tmp): 512MB to 10GB
- Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)

**Deployment:**

- Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
- Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
- Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup
- Size of environment variables: 4KB

## Lambda SnapStart

Improve your Lambda functions performance up to 10x at no extra cost for Java 11 and above.

When it's enabled, function is invoked from a pre-intialized state (no function initialization from scratch)

When you publish a new version:
- Lambda initalizes your function
- Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function
- Snapshot is cached for low-latency access

## Lambda@Edge & CloudFront Functions

Many modern applications execute some form of the logic at the edge

**Edge function:**
- A code that you write and attach to the CloudFront distributions
- Runs close to your users to minimize latency

CloudFront provides two types: **CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge**, you don't have to manage any servers, deployed globally

Use case: Customize the CDN content
  - Website Security and Privacy
  - Dynamic Web app at the edge
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
  - Intelligently Route Across Orgins and Data Centers
  - Bot mitigation at the edge
  - Real-time image transformation
  - A/B Testing
  - User authentication and authorization
  - User prioritization
  - User tacking and analytics

Pay only what you use

**CloudFront Functions**

Typical CloudFront communications:

CloudFront Functions are lightweight functions written in JS - it's for high-scale, latency sensitive CDN customizations. Sub-ms startup times, millions requests/second

Used to change Viewer requests and responses:
**- Viewer Request:** After CloufFront receives a request from a viewer
**- Viewer Response:** Before CF forward the response to the viewer

Native feature of CF

**Lambda@Edge**

Lambda functions written in NodeJS or Python
Scales up to 1000s of requests/second

Used to change CF requests and responses:
- Viewer request - after CF receives a request from a viewer
- Origin Request - Before CF forward the request to the origin
- Origin Response - After CF receives the response from the origin
- Viewer Response - before CF forwards the response to the viewer

Author your functions on AWS Region, the CF replicates to its locations

## Lambda in VPC

Lambda by default is launched in an AWS-owned VPC - therefore outside your VPC and won't work with any services within the VPC.

We can launch Lambda in a VPC to fix this - You must define the VPC ID, the subnets and NSG. Lambda then will create an ENI in your subnets

A major use case is Lambda with RDS Proxy
