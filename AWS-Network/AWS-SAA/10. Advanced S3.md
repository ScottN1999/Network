Moving objects can be done manually but can be automated using **Lifecycle Rules**

## Lifecycle Rules

**Transition Actions** - configure objects to transition to another storage class
  - Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
  - Move to glaciver for archiving after 6 months

**Expiration Actions** - Configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
  - Access logs can be set to delete after 365 days
  - **Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled)**
  - Can be use to delete incomplete multi-part uploads

Rules can be create with a certain prefix (example:s3://mybucket/mp3/*)
Rules can be created for a certain objects Tags (example:Department:Finance)
