## RDS Summary

- Managed PostgreSQL / MySQL / Oracle / SQL Sever / DB2 / MariaDB / Custom

- Provisioned RDS Instance Size and EBS volume type and size

- Auto-scaling capability

- Support Read Replicas and Multi AZ

- Security through IAM, NSG, KMS, SSL

- Automate backup with PITR (Up to 35 days)

- Manual DB Snapshot for long-term recovery

- Managed and scheduled matenace (with downtime)

- Support for IAM Authentication with RDS proxy, integration with Secrets Manager

- RDS Custom for access and customize the underlying instance (Orcale and SQL Server)

**Use cases:** Store relational datasets (RDMS / Online Transaction Proccessing (OLTP)), perform SQL queries, transactions


## Aurora Summary

- Compatible API for PostgreSQL / MySQL, seperation of storage and compute

- Storage data is stored in 6 replicas, across 3 AZ - HA, self healing, auto-scaling

- Compute: Cluster of DB instance across multiple AZ, auto-scaling of read replicas

- Cluster: Custom endpoints for writer and reader DB instances

- Same securitY / monitoring / maintenace features as RDS

- Know the backup and restore options for Aurora

**Aurora Serverless -** for unpredictable / intermitten workloads, no capacitty planning

**Aurora Global -** Up to 16 GB Read instances in each region, < 1 seconds storage replication

**Aurora Machine Learning -** Perform ML using SageMaker and Comprehend on Aurora.

**Aurora Database Cloning:** New cluster from existing one, faster than a snapshot

**Use case:** Sam as RDS, but with less maintenance / more flexibility / more features / more performance.


## ElastiCache - Summary

- Managed Redis / Memcached (similiar offering as RDS, but for caches)

- In-memory data store, sub millisecond latency

- Select an ElastiCache instance type

- Support for Clustering (Redis) and Multi AZ, Read replicas (sharding)

- Security through IAM, NSGs, KMS, Redis Auth

- Backup / Snapshot/ PITR

- Managed and scheduled maintenance

- **Requires some application code changes to be leveraged**

**Use cases:** Key/value store, frequent reads, less writes, cache results for DB queries, store session data for websites, cannot use SQL.


## DynamoDB - Summary

- AWS proprietary technology managed serverless NoSQL db, millisecond latency
- Capacity modes: provisioned capacity with optional auto-scaling or on-demand capacity

- Can replace ElastiCache as a key/value store (store session data for example, using TTL feature)

- HA, Multi-AZ by default, Reads and writes are decoupled, transaction capability

- DAX cluster for read cache, microsecond latency

- Security, authentication and authorization is done through IAM

- Event processing: DynamoDB streams with Lambda, or kinesis data streams

- Global table feature: active-active setup across regions

- Automate backups to 35d with PITR (restore to new table), or on-demand backups

- Export to S3 without using RCU within the PITR window, import from S3 without using WCU
- **GREAT FOR RAPIDLY EVOLVE SCHEMAS**

**Use case:** - Serverless applications development (small documents 100s kb), distributed serverless cache


## S3 - Summary

- Key / value storage for objects

- Great for bigger objects > not so great for smaller

- Serverless, scales infinitely, max object size is 5 TB, versioning capability

- **Tiers:** S3 Standard, S3 IA, S3 intillgent, S3 Glaicer + lifecycle policy

- **Features:** Versioning, Encryption, Replication, MFA-Delete, Access Logs

- **Security:** IAM, bucket policies, ACL, Access Points, Object Lambda, CORS, Object/Vaault Lock

- **Encryption:** SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, client-side, TLS, default encrypt

- **Batch Operations**: Ob object using S3 batch, listing files using S3 inventory

- **Performance**: Multi-part upload, S3 Transfer acceleration, S3 Select

- **Automation:** S3 Event Notifications (SNS, SQS, Lambda, EventBridge)

**Use cases:** Static files, key value store for big files, website hosting
