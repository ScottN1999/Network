# Disaster Recovery 

- RPO: Recovery Point Objective
- RTO: Recovery Time Objective

RPO = The point of where you choose to have a point of restore

RTO = When you recover - the downtime

The smaller you want these gaps is gonna depend how much you want to pay.


## DR Strategies

- Backup and restore
- Pilot light
- Warm standby
- Hot site / Multi site approach

## Backup and Restore ( High RPO )

- Cheap and easy
- High RPO and RTO

## Pilot Light

- A samll version of the app is always running in the cloud
- Useful for critical core (pilot light)
- Very similar to backup and restore
- Faster than backup and restore as critical systems are already up

## Warm standby

- Full system is up and running, but at minimum size
- Upon disaster we can scale to production load
- More costly because stuff is running but less RTO and RPO

## Multi Site / Hotsite approach

- Very low RTO - very expensive
- Full production scale is running AWS and on prem (active-active setup)

## DR in AWS

- **Backup**
  - EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / snapshots, etc...
  - Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication
  - From onprem: Snowball or storage gateway
 
- **High Availability**
  - Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region
  - Multi AZ (RDS, Elasticache, EFS, S3)
  - Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect
 
- **Replication**
  - RDS (Cross region), Aurora + Global DBs
  - Database replication from onprem to RDS
  - Storage gateway
 
- **Automation**
  - CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment
  - Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail
  - AWS Lambda functions for customized automations
 
- **Chaos**
  - Netflix has a "simian-army" randomly terminating EC2 (testing)
 
# DMS - Database Migration Service

Quickly and securely migrate DBs to AWS, resilient, self healing - the source DB remains available during the migration.

Continous Data Replication using CDC - you must create an EC2 to perform the replication tasks.

## DMS Sources Targets

**Sources:**
- Onprem and EC2 instance DBs: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, Postgre, Mongo, SAP, DB2
- Azure SQL DB
- RDS
- S3
- DocumentDB

**Targets:**
- Onprem and EC2 instances dbs
- RDS
- RedShift, DynamoDB, S3
- OpenSearch Service
- Kinesis Data Streams
- Apache Kafka
- DocumentDB and Neptune
- Redis and Babelfish

## AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

This converts your DB's Schema from one engine to another.

Example OLTP: (SQL Server or Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
Example OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to RedShift

**You don't always need SCT - if they have the same engine it's not needed**

## RDS and Aurora MySQL Migrations (specifically for MySQL)

**RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL:**
  - Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS MySQL restored as MySQL Aurora DB
  - Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS MySQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost $)

**External MySQL to Aurora MySQL**
  - Option 1:
    - Use Percona XtraBackup to create a file backup in S3
    - Create an Aurora MySQL DB from S3
  - Options 2:
    - Create an Aurora MySQL DB
    - Use the MySQLDump utility to migrate MySQL into Aurora (slower than S3 method)
   
**Use DMS if both DBs are up and running**

**This is the same for DynamoDB**


## AWS Backup

Fully managed service - centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services, no need to create custom scripts and manual processes

Supported services:
- EC2 / EBS
- S3
- RDS / Aurora / DynamoDB
- DocumentDB / Neptune
- EFS / FSx
- AWS Storage Gateway (Volume)

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/654f09b5-cb91-45ff-983d-c4f4a09746ea)


Support cross region and cross acount backups

Supports PITR for supported services, on-demand and scheduled backups.

You create backup policies known as **Back up plans** Defines:
  - backup frequency
  - backup windows
  - Transition to cold storage (never, days, weeks, months, years)
  - Retention period

## AWS Backup Vault Lock

Enforce WORM (write once read many) state for all the backups that your store, additional layer of defense to protect your backups against:
  - Inadvertent or malicious delete operations
  - Updates that shorten or alter retention periods

Even the root user cannot delete backups when enabled



# AWS Application Discovery Service

Plan migration projects by gathering info about onprem data centers

Scan server utilization data and dependency mapping are important for migrations

**Agentless Discovery (AWS Agentless discovery connector)**
  - VM inventory, config, and performance history such as CPU, memory, and disk usage

**Agent-based discovery (AWS Application discovery agent)**
  - System config, system performance, running processes, and details of the network connection between systems


Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration Hub


## AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)

Lift-and-shift (rehost) solution which simplify **migrating** applications to AWS - converts your physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to run nativerly on AWS.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/6ea245ab-5cdc-42f0-a688-32353a5f9cc0)


Supports a wide range of platforms, OS, and DB - minimal downtime and reduced costs.

# Transferring large amount of data into AWS

Example: transfer 200 TB of data in the cloud. We have 100 Mbps internet connection

- **Over the internet / Site-to-site VPN**
  - Immediate to setup
  - will take 185 days
 
- **Over direct connect 1Gbps:**
  - Log for the on-time setup (over a month)
  - will take 18.5 days
 
- **Snowball**
  - Will take 2-3 snowballs in parralel
  - Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transger
  - Can be combined with DMS
 
**For ongoing replication / transfers:** Site-to-site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync.

# VMWare Cloud on AWS

Some customers use VMWare Cloud to manage their onprem Data Center.

They want to extend the Data Center capacity to AWS, but keep using the VMWare cloud software ... enter VMWare Cloud on AWS.

**Usecase:**
  - Migrate your VMware vSphere-based workloads to AWS
  - Run your production workloads across VMWare vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments
  - Have a disaster recover strategy
