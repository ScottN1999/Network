# AWS Organizations 


Global service which allows to managed multiple AWS accounts - the main account is the management account, other accounts are member accounts. Member accounts can only be part of one organization.

Consolidated billing across all accounts - single payment method > pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3 ...)

**Shared reserved instances and Savings Plans discount across account**

**Advantages:**
  - Multi accound vs one account multi VPC
  - Use tagging standards for billing purposes
  - Enable cloudtrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
  - Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account
  - Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes

**Security: Service Control Policies (SCP)**
  - IAM policies applied to OU or Accounts to restrict Users and Roles
  - They do not apply to the management account (full admin power)
  - Must have an explicit allow (does not all anything by default - like IAM)
