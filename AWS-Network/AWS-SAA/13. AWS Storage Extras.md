**Data Migration with Snow**

In general it takes this long usually (not SNOW)

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/f8bcc8a6-8c54-4e98-a0cc-9f798d965aba)

Challenges:
- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
- Connection stability

**Why Snow?** If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices which allows data migration offline

## Snowball Edge

Physical data transport solution: Moves TBs or POVs of data in or out of AWS - Alternative to moving data over the network and paying network fees.

Pay per data transfer job. Provide block storage and S3-compatible object storage.

There is 2 classes:
- Snowball Edge Storage optimised
  - 80 TB of HDD or 210TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage

- Snowball Edge Compute Optimised
  - 42 TB of HDD or 28TB VNME capacity for block and S3

## Snowcone 

Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged and secure, withstands harsh environments

Light (2.1kg) - this device is used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer. 

Snowcone - 8tb of HDD 
Snowcone SSD - 14tb of SSD

Use snowcone where Snowball doesn't fit (space-constrained environment) must provide your own battery / cables

2 options to send data back to AWS: Sent offline, or connect it internet and use AWS DataSync to send it back

## Snowmobile (IN MARCH 2024 AWS QUIETLY REMOVED FROM THEIR WEBSITE RIP MY FAV SERVICE :((( )

Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)

Each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (1 EB will require 10 snowmobiles)

High security, temp controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance.

Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB

**Snowball into Glacier**

Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly

You must use S3 first, in combination with an s3 lifecycle policy

- Scale up to 10s of HB/S, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data

Storage Options:
- SSD: Latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, ...)
- HDD: Broad spectrum workloads (home directory, CMS,...)

Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastrcuture (VPN or Direct Connect)
Can be configured to be Multi-AZ and data is backed up daily to S3.

## FSx for Lustre
Lustre is type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing - the name Lustre is derive from "Linux" and "cluster"

When thinking of Lustre, it's important to mention it's for **High Performance Computing (HPC)** - think examples like Machine Learning, Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation. 

Scales up to 100s GB/S, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies.

Storage Options:
- SSD - Low latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small and random file operations

**Seamless integration with S3**
- Can't "read S3" as a filesystem (through FSx)
- Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)

Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastrcuture (VPN or Direct Connect)

## FSx File System Deployment Options

**Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)**

## AWS Storage Gateway

**Hybrid Cloud for Storage**

AWS is pushing for "Hybrid cloud"
- Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud - part onprem

This can be due to
- Long cloud migrations
- Security requirements
- Compliance requirements
- IT strategy

S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?

**Storage Gateway**

## Cloud Native Options

Block:
- EBS and EC2 Instance Store

File
- EFS and FSx

Object:
- S3 and Glacier

## What is Storage Gateway

Bridge between onprem data and cloud data - use cases:

- Disaster recovery
- Backup and restore (cloud migration)
- Tiered storage
- Onprem cache and low latency file access

Types of Storage Gateway
- S3 File Gateway
- FSx File Gateway
- Volume Gateway
- Tape Gateway

## S3 File Gateway

Configured S3 bucket are accessible using NFS and SMB protocol
Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway. Supports all tiering of S3 > **use a lifecycle policy for glacier**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/c8f8be9c-41b4-41a0-bcdc-fcc54f17e690)


Bucket access using IAM for each File Gateway
SMB Protocol has integration with AD for user auth

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/cc6623b8-5b07-4e37-8e99-5c8de219b9ed)

## FSx Gateway

Native access to FSx for Windows File Server
**Local cache for frequently accessed data < main reason**

Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, AD)

Useful for group file shares and home directories

## Volume gateway

Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3 - backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore onprem volumes.

**Cached volumes:** Low latency access to move recent data
**Stored volumes:** Entire dataset is onprem, scheduled backups to S3

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/dc48a0ec-8e91-4813-a548-9f641ab6830c)

## Tape Gateway

Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes. With tape gateway, companies uise the same processes but in the cloud > Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by S3 and Glacier

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/4ca3e6ed-c699-409c-9900-9b6edef792be)


Backup data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/07e86995-f4a0-428c-b7db-acfed2cd375b)

## Storage Gateway - Hardware Appliance
  
Using Storage Gateway means you need onprem virtualisation - otherwise, you can use a **Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance** > can be bought from amazon.com

Works with file, volume, and tape gateway

Has the required CPU, memory, network, SSD cached resource

Helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers

## AWS Transfer Family

A fully-managed service for file transfers into and out of S3 or Amazon EFS using the FTP protocol.

Supported Protocols:
- AWS Transfer for FTP
- AWS Transfer for FTPS (FTP over SSL)
- SFTP

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/77be8b58-1a46-46e4-a39e-ea155fc11e71)


Managed infrastructure, scalable, reliable, HA (multi-az)

Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
Store and manage users' credentials within the service.

Integrate with existing auth systems (AD, LDAP, Okta, AWS Cognito, etc)

Usage: Sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP

## AWS DataSync

Moves large amount of data to and from
  - Onprem / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API) - Needs agent
  - AWS to AWS (different storage services) - no agent needed

Can sync to:
- S3 (any class)
- EFS
- FSx

Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly

**File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB ...)**

- One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup a bandwidth limit
