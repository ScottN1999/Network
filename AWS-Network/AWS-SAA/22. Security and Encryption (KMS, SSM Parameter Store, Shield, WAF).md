# AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

Anytime you hear encryption for an AWS service, most likely will be KMS.

With KMS, AWS manages encryption keys for us > an easy way to to control access your data.

Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail.

**Never store your secrets in plaintext, especially in code!**
  - KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI)

## KMS Keys Types

**Symmetric (AES-256 Keys)**
  - Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
  - AWS Services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
  - You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)

**Asymmetric (RSA and ECC key pairs)**
  - Public (Encrypt) and Private key (Decrypt) pair
  - Used for Encrypt/Decrpyth, or Sign/verify operations
  - Use case: Encryption outside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API

Types of KMS Keys:

  - AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)
  - AWS Managed Key: **free** (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)
  - Customer managed keys created in KMS: **$1/month**
  - Customer managed keys imported: **$1/month**
  - + pay for API calls to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

Automatic Key rotation
  - AWS-managed KMS key: automatic every 1 year
  - Customer-managed KMS key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
  - Imported KMS key: only manual rotation possible using alias

## Copying encrypted snapshots across regions

To copy the snapshot across to another region, we have re-encrypt with another key.

## KMS Key Policies

Control access to KMS keys, "similar" to S3 bucket policies, the difference is that you cannot control access without them.

**Default KMS key policy:**
  - Created if you don't provide a specific KMS Key Policy
  - Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account

**Custom KMS Key Policy:**
  - Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
  - Define who can administer the key
  - Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key

## Copying Snapshots across accounts

1. Create a Snapshot, encrypted with your KMS Key (**Customer managed key)**
2. **Attach a KMS Key Policy to authorize cross-account access**
3. Share the encrypted snapshot
4. (in target) Create a copy of the Snapshot, encrypt it with a CMK in your account
5. Create a volume from the snapshot

# KMS Multi-Region Keys

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/7c50961d-cb88-4239-85a3-5921ed5e49ba)

Identical KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably, multi-region keys have the same key ID, key material, automatic rotation ...

Allows us to encrpyt in one region and decrypt in other regions > no need to re-encrypt or making cross-region API calls.

KMS Multi-region are NOT global (Primary + replicas), each multi-region key is managed **independently.**

Use case: global client-side encryption, encryption on Global DynamoDB or Global Aurora

## DynamoDB Global Tables and KMS Multi-Region Keys Client-Side encryption

We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our DynamoDB table tuisng the **Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client**

Combined with Global Tables, the client-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions.

If we use a multi-region key, replicated in the same region as the DynamoDB Global table, then clients in these region can use low-latency API calls the KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side.

Using client-side encryption we can protect specific fields and guarantee only decryption if the client has access to an API key.

## Global Aurora and KMS Multi-region keys client-side encryption

Same as above.


# S3 Replication Encryption Considerations

**Unencrypted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by default**

Objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) can be replicated.

**For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS**, you need to enable the option
  - Specify which KMS Key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket
  - Adapt the KMS Key Policy for the target key
  - An IAM Role with kms:Decrypt for the source KMS Key and kms:Encrypt for the target KMS key.
  - You might get KMS throttling errors, in which case you can for a Service Quotas increase.

**You can use multi-region AWS KMS Keys, but they are currently trated as independent keys by Amazon S3 (the object will still be decrypted and then encrypted)**

# AMI Sharing Process Encrypted via KMS

1. AMI in source accounts is encrypted with KMS Key from source account
2. Must modify the image attribute to add a **Launch Permission** which corresponds to the specified target AWS account
3. Must share the KMS Keys used to encrypted the snapshot the AMI references with the target account / IAM role
4. The IAM Role / User in the target account must have the permissions to DescribeKey, ReEncrypted, CreateGrant, Decrypt
5. When launching an EC2 instance from the AMI, optionally the target account can specify a new KMS key in its own account to re-encrypt the volumes.

# SSM Parameter Store

Secure storage for configuration and secrets > optional seamless encryption using KMS. It's serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK.

Version tracking of config/secrets. 

Notifications with EventBridge, integration with CloudFormation

# AWS Secrets Manager

Meant for storing secrets, capability to force **rotation of secrets** every X days. Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda), integration with **Amazon RDS (MySQL, Postgre, Aurora)**

Secrets are encrypted using KMS.

Mostly meant for RDS integration

## Multi-region secrets

Replicate Secrets across multiple AWS regions, Secrets Manager keeps read replicas in sync with the primary secret.

Ability to promote a read replica secret to a standlone Secret.

Use case: multi-region apps, DR, multi-region DB

## AWS Certificate Manager 

Easily provisison, managed, and deploy **TLS Certificates**

Provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS), supports both public and private TLS certs (free for public TLS certs) - has the ability to automatically renew TLS certs. 

Integrations with (load TLS Certs on)
  - all ELBS

## Proccess of Requesting Public Certs

1. List domain names to be included in the cert
     - FQDNS
     - Wildcard domains: *.example.com
  
2. Select validation method: DNS validation or email validation
     - DNS Validation is preferred for automation purposes
     - Email validation will send emails to contact addresses in the WHOIS database
     - DNS Validation will leverage a CNAME record to DNS config (ex:Route53)

3. It will take a few hours to get verified
4. The public cert will be enrolled for automatic renewal
    - ACM automatically renews ACM-generated certs 60d before expiry
  
## Import Public Certs

Option to generate the cert outside of ACM then import it
  
**No automatic renewal,** must import a new cert before expiry

**ACM sends daily expiration events** starting 45 days prior to expiration
  - the number of days can be configured
  - Events are appearing in EventBridge

**AWS Config** has a managed rule named *acm-certificate-expiration-check* to check for expiring certs (configurable number of days)

# AWS WAF

Protects your web application from comme web exploits (layer 7)

Deployed on:
  - ALB
  - API Gateway
  - CloudFront
  - AppSync GraphQL API
  - Cognitio User Pool

Defines Web ACL rules:
  - IP Set: up to 10,000 IPS - use multiple rules for more IPS
  - HTTP Headers, HTTP body, or URI strings protects from **common SQL injection or cross-site scripting**
  - Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
  - **Rate-based rules** (to count occurences of events) - DDoS protection

Web ACLS are Regional except for CloudFront

A rule group is a **reusable set of rules that you can add to a web ACL**

# AWS Shield - protect from DDoS

**AWS Shield Standard**
  - Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
  - Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other l3,l4 attacks

**AWS Shield Advanced:**
- Optional DDoS mitigation service ($3k per month per org)
- Protect against more sophisticated attack on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, Route 53
- 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team
- Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS
- Shield advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF rules to mitigate L7 attacks.


# AWS Firewall Manager

**Manage rules in all account of an AWS Organisation**

Security policy: common set of security rules
  - WAF rules (ALB, API Gateways, CloudFront)
  - AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, NLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
  - Security Groups for EC2, ALB and ENI resources in VPC
  - AWS Network Firewall (VPC Level)
  - Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewal
  - Policies are created at the region level

**Rules are applied to new resources that are created across all and future accounts in your org.**

## WAF vs Firewall Manager vs Shield

**WAF, Shield and Firewall Manager are used together for comprehensive protection**

- Define your Web ACL rules in WAF
- For granular protection of your resource, WAF alone is the correct choice
- If you want to use WAF across accounts, accelerate WAF config, automate the protection of new resources, use Firewall Manager with WAF
- Shield advanced adds additional features on top of AWS WAF, such as dedicated support from the Shield Response Team (SRT) and advanced reporting. If prone to frequent DDoS > get shield advanced.
