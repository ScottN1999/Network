# Route 53

**What is DNS**

Domain Name System which translates human friendly hostnames into machine IPs > www.google.com = 172.16.1.3

DNS is the backbone of the internet - there is a hierarchical name stucture

## DNS terms

**Domain Registrar:** Where you register your domain names - Route53, GoDaddy, ...
**DNS Records:** A,AAAA,CNAME,NS, ...
**Zone file:** Contains all the DNS records - how to match hostnames to addresses
**Name server:** Resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or non-authoritative)
**Top Level Domain (TLD):** .com, .gov, .org
**Second Level Domain (SLD):** amazon.com, google.com

## How DNS works

<img width="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/ac12e284-dae8-4bab-b906-81a5b97396e1">

Your web browser will ask your local DNS server (managed by ISP/your company) if it has ever seen the example.com domain - if it has not been cache'd it will then ask the root dns and recursively find it, each DNS server provides some details (e.g. The root dns server will know .com's name server is IP: 1.2.3.4)

## Route 53

High available, scalable, full managed and _authoritative DNS_
  - **Authorative** = the customer (you) can update the DNS records

Route 53 is also a domain registrar, it has the ability to check the health of your resources (it is the only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA.

## Route 53 - Records
How you want to route traffic for a domain
Each record contains:
  - Domain/subdomain - e.g. example.com
  - Record type - e.g A or AAAA
  - Value - e.g 12.42.134.13
  - Routing Policy - how route 53 responds to queries
  - TTL (Time-to-live) - Amount of time the record cached at DNS resolvers

Route 53 Supports the following DNS record types:
- Must know - A, AAAA, CNAME, NS
- Advanced but good to know - CAA, DS, MX, NAPTR, PTR, SOA, TXT, SPF, SRV

## Route 53 - Record types
- A - Maps a hostname to ipv4
- AAAA - Maps a hostname to ipv6
- CNAME - Maps a hostname to another hostname
  - the target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
  - Can't create a CNAME record for the top node a DNS namespace (Zone apex)
  - Example: You can't create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com

- NS - Name servers for the hosted zone
  - controls how traffic is routed for a domain

## Route 53 - Hosted zones
A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains. 

- **Public Hosted Zones** - contains records that specify how to route traffic on the internet (public domain names).
application1.mypublicdomain.com

- **Private Hosted Zones** - Contain records that specify how you route traffic with one or more VPCs (private domain names)
application1.company.internal

 $0.5 per month per hosted zone, when registering a domain name you pay at least a minimum of $12 per year

## TTL

High TTL - E.g. 24 hour (most recommended option)
- Less traffic on route 53 ( as it's cache'd on the client)
- Possibly outdated records
_it's recommended if changing DNS records to change the TTL to something low and only do it after the initial ttl has finished (24hr)_

Low TTL - e.g. 60 seconds
- More traffic on Route 53 ($$)
- Records are outdated for less time
- Easy to change records

Except for alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record

## CNAME vs Alias 
AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront... ) expose an AWS hostname:
lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want **myapp.domain.com**

CNAME:
- Point a hostname to any other hostname (app.mydomain.com > example.example.com)
- **ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (app.mydomain.com not mydomain.com)**

Alias:
- Points a hostname to an AWS resource (app.mydomain.com > example.example.com)
- **Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (will work for mydomain.com and app.mydomain.com)**
- Free of charge
- Native healthcheck
- Maps a hostname to an AWS resource (Only for AWS, not DNS usual)
- Automatically recognises changes in resource's IP addresses
- Unlike CNAME, it can be used for the top node of a DNS napespace (zone apex)
- Alias record is always of type A/AAAA for AWS resources
- TTL cannot be set

Cannot set ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name

## Route 53 - Routing Policies

Defines how Route 53 responds to DNS queries, important not to get confused by 'Routing'.
  - It's not the same as Load Balancer routing which routes the traffic
  - DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries

Route 53 supports the follow routing policies
- Simple
- Weighted
- Failover
- Latency based
- Geolocation
- Multi-value answer
- Geoproximity (Using Route 53 traffic flow feature)

## Routing Policy - Simple
Typically, route traffic to a single resource - however can specify multiple values in the same record. If multiple values are returned a random one is chosen by the **client**

<img width="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/946a9be6-b733-4394-b9c5-935e59c040f9">


When ALIAS is enabled, specify only one AWS resource as a target - can't be assoicated with health checks

## Routing Policies - Weighted
Control the % of the requests that go to each specific resource - assign each record a relative weight:

<img width="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/71fb34a7-db9b-45ad-a748-18ba9212647a">

Weights don't need to equate to 100 - they're just indicative how much traffic we want to send to the instances compared to the other records in the DNS name.

<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/4ce5012c-edff-4426-8148-bdf1b1322cf1">


DNS records must have the same name (e.g. dev.myapp.com) and type (A, AAAA, SPF, etc) different instances (by ip) - can be associated with health checks

Assigning a weight of 0 to a record to stop sending traffic to a resource, if all recourd have weight of 0, then all records will be returned equally.

**Use case:** load balancing between regions, testing new application versions

## Routing Policies - Latency based
Redirect to the resource that has the least latency close to us - super helpful when latency for users is a priority (this latency based on traffic between users and AWS regions) can be assoicated with health checks. it's just similiar to cloudfront to be honest

<img width="399" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/5503bf01-ed15-472b-b37b-f6ba8a9e7c67">


## Routing Policies - Failover (Active-Passive)

If an EC2 is unhealthy there is a failover EC2 that is waiting and standing by until the primary EC2 becomes unhealthy. (very obvious by the name)

## Routing Policies - Geolocation
Apparently very different from Latency-based, this is because the **routing is based on user location**.

Specify location by Continent, Country or by US State (if there's overlapping most precise location selected) - should create "Default" record (in case there's no match on location).

Use case: website localization, restrict content distribution, load balancing.

Can be associated with health checks

## Geoproximity Routing Policy



## Routing Policies - IP-Based Routing
Routing is based on clients' IP addresses. You provide a list of CIDRs for your clients and the corresponding endpoint/locations (user-IP-to-endpoint mappings)

Use cases: Optimise performance, reduce network costs
Example: route end users from a particular ISP to a specific endpoint

<img width="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1a536731-29bb-4e69-92cd-1aa333386e12">

## Routing Polcieis - Multi-value
Use when routing to multiple resources, R53 return multiple values/resources. Can be associated with Health Checks (return values for healthy resources only). Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi-value query. **Multi-value is not a subsitute for ELB**

## Route 53 - health checks
HTTP health checks are only for **public resources**

<img width="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/e95c1a8f-7af3-457a-a861-9d1e00fde5bb">


Health check => Automated DNS failover:
## - Health checks that monitor an endpoint (application, server, other aws resource)
 - About 15 global health checkers will check the endpoint health
    - Healthy/unhealthy threshold - 3 (default)
    - Interval - 30 sec (can set to 10 sec - higher cost)
    - Supported protocol: HTTP, HTTPS and TCP
    - If > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint is healthy, Route 53 considers it **healthy**. Otherwise, it's **unhealthy**.
    - Ability to choose which locations you want R53 to use.
  - Health checks pass onyly when the endpoint responds with HTTP 2xx and 3xx status codes
  - Health checks can be setup to pass/fail based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of response (for text based responses)
  - Configure your router/firewall to allows incoming requests from route 53 health checkers

## - Health checks that monitor other health checks (calculated health checks)
  - Combine the result of multiple health checks into a single health check
  - You can **OR, AND, or NOT**
  - can monitor up to 256 Child Health Checks
  - Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass
  - Usage: Perform maintenance to your website without causing all health checks to fail

- Health check that monitor CloudWatch alarms (more control) - e.g. throttles of DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics, (helpful for private resources)

Health checks are integrated with cloudwatch metrics (has its own metrics)


##  Health Checks - Private Hosted Zones
Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC (Global service), they can't access **private** endpoints (private VPC or on-premises resource). So what you can do is create a **CloudWatch metric** and assoicate a **CloudWatch Alarm**, then create a Health Check that checks the alarm itself.

## Domain Registar vs DNS Service
You buy or register your domain name with a domain registrar typivally by paying annual charges (e.g. GoDaddy, Amazon Registrar Inc, ...). 

The domain registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS records - but you can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records.

Example: purchase the domain from GoDaddy and use Route 53 to manage your DNS records

<img width="635" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/f74a7ab7-f9a4-44b9-bb5d-56c8cc694328">

Notes: 
You can buy your domain on a 3rd party registrar, you can still use Route 53 as the DNS service provider.

1. Create a hosted zone in route 53
2. Update NS records on 3rd part website to use Route 53 Name Servers

- Domain Registrar != DNS Service
- But every Domain Registrar usually comes with some DNS features
