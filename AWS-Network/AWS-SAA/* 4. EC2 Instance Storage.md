# EBS Volumes

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a **network** drive you can attach to your instances while they run.

It allows your instance to persist data, even after their termination

They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the AWS CCP level), they are bound the a specific AZ 

Think of it a bascially a network USB stick

Free tier: 30GB of free EBS stoage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month


## EBS continued

It uses the network to communicate to the instance, which means there is a bit of latency - it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly (due to it being a network drive)

**IT'S LOCKED TO AN AZ**
- An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to 1b
- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it (basically a copy)

Has provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS), can increase over time

So, at an AWS CCP level - it's important to note that only one EBS Volume can be attached to a singular EC2, but at a SAA level it's important to mention that you can multi-attach to one EC2. You can also have an EBS volume not attached and can be quickly configured to be attached (powerful).


### Deleting an EBS

By default, will delete the root EBS volume - but not any other EBS volumes (obviously this can be changed), use case be if you want to preserve the root volume when an EC2 is terminated (root volumes contain the image used to boot the instance, basically the operation system partition in a PC)

# EBS Snapshots

Is a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time, is not necessary to detach a colume to do a snapshot but it's recommended.

**can copy snapshot across AZ or region (uses S3 buckets, as it's durable)**

## EBS Snapshot features

- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive

- Recycle bin for EBS Snapshots
Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion, can specify the retetion (from 1 day to 1 year)

- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
Force full initialisation of snapshot to have no latency on their first use ($$$)
