# IP addressing

**Private vs Public IP (IPv4)**

Networking has 2 sorts of IPs - IPv4 & IPv6

- IPv4: 1.160.10.240 (4 octets of 0-255)
- IPv6: 1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf

Only focus for SAA is v4, as v6 right now is mostly for IoT

**Public IP:** 
- Can be identified on the internet
- Must be unique across the internet
- can be geo-located

**Private IP:**
- Can only be identified on a private network
- Unique on the private network
- **BUT** two private networks can have the same IPs (because of NAT duh)
- Machines connect to WWW using an internet gatway (a proxy)
- Only specified range of IPs can be used as private IP (Class A, B, C etc)

## Elastic IPs

When you stop and then start and EC2, it can change its public IP
If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP.

An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don't delete it.

You can attach it to one instance at a time.

With an Elastic IP, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account (can ask AWS to increase if needed)

**Overall, try to avoid Elastic IP:**
- Often reflect poor architectual decisions
- Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
- Or, as we'll see later, use a load balancer and don't use a public IP

## Placement groups

Sometimes you want control over the EC2 instance placement strategy - that strategy can be defined using placement groups.

When you create a palcement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:

- Cluster: Clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single AZ (high performance, high risk)

- Spread: Spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) - for critical applications

- Partition (is new): Spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra).

## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

Logical component in a VPC that represent a virtual network card, the ENI can have the following attributes:
- Primary private IPv4, one ore more secondary IPv4
- One Elastic (IPv4) per private IPv4
- One Public IPv4
- One or more NSGs
- A MAC address

You can create ENI independently and attach the mon the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover.

**Bound to a specific AZ**

Having multiple ENI's, makes for easy network failover. When a EC2 is terminated, the default ENI that comes with the instance is deleted but all manual created ENI's assigned to an instance remains unchanged (just one less EC2 attached to that ENI)

## EC2 Hibernate

Stop - The data on the disk (EBS) is kept intact in the next start
Terminate - Any EBS volumes (root) also set-up to be destroyed is lost

On start, the following happens:
- First start: The OS boots and the EC2 User Data script is run
- Following starts: the OS boots up
- Then your application starts, caches get warmed up, and that can take time

**What is hibernate?**
The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved - The instance boot is much faster! (the OS is not stopped / restarted)

Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume - the root EBS volume bust be encrypted.

**Use case:**
- Long-running processing
- Saving the RAM state
- Services that take time to initialise
