# Amazon Athena

Serverless query service to analyse data stored in S3 using SQL to query the files.

Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet

Pricing $5 per TB of data scanned.

Commonly use with Amazon Quicksight for reporting/dashboards

**Use cases**: Business intelligence / analytics / reporting, analyse and query VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrail trails, etc.

**Exam tip:** Analyse data in S3 using serverless SQL > Athena

## Athena - Performance Improvement

Use **columnar data** for cost-savings (less scan) 
  - Apache Parquet or ORC is recommended
  - Hugh performance improvement
  - Use Glue to convert your data to Paquet or ORC

Compress data for smaller retrievals (gzip, zlip, zstd)

Partition datasets in S3 for easy querying on virtual columns
  - s3://yourBucket/pathToTable
    - /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>
      - /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>

etc.

Example: s3://athena-eg/flight/parquet/year=1999/month=1/day=1/

Use larger files ( > 128 MB) to minimise overheard

## Athena - Federated Query

Allows you to run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non relational, object, and custom data sources (AWS or onprem)

Use Data Source Connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run Federated Queries

Store the results back in S3

# Redshift

Redshift is based of PostgreSQL, but it's **not used for OLTP**

It's OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data  warehousing)

10x better performance than other data warehouses, scales to PBs of data

**Columnar** storage of data (instead of row based) and parallel query engine

Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned.

Has a SQL interface for performing the queries, BI tools such as Amazon Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it.

**vs Athena:** Faster qeuries/joins/aggregations thanks to indexes.

## Redshift Cluster

- **Leader node:** For query planning, results aggregation
- **Compute node:** For performing the queries, send results to leader

You provision the node size in advanced, you can use Reserved Instances for cost savings.

## Snapshots and DR

Redshift has "Multi-AZ" mode for some clusters

Snapshots are point-in-time backups of a cluster > stored internally in S3.

Snapshots are incremental.

You can restore a snapshot into a new **cluster**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/ef8e0f3a-e6bc-4c33-94e3-05300acf3960)


- Automated: every 8 hours, every 5gb, or on a schedule. Set retention
- Manual: Snapshot is retained until you delete it

You can configure Redshift to automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) of a cluster to another AWS Region

## Loading data into Redshift

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/7118864a-5c3a-436c-a022-3799ff3e5726)

## Redshift Spectrum

Query data that is already in S3 without loading it.

**Must have a Redshift cluster available to start the query**

The query is then submitted to thousands of Redshift Spectrum nodes.

# Amazon OpenSearch

Used to be called Amazon ElasticSearch, in DynamoDB, queries only exist by primary key or indexes ... **Wtih OpenSearch, you can search any field, even partially matches**

It's common to use OpenSearch as a complement to another database.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/d914e6a9-2f35-4435-b6dd-ad70d5122de0)


Two modes: **managed cluster or severless cluster.**


Does not natively SQL (can be enabled by a plugin)

Ingestion from Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS IoT, and CloudWatch Logs

Security through Cognito and IAM, KMS decryption, TLS

Comes with OpenSearch Dashboards (visualization)

# Amazon EMR (Elastic Map Reduce)

Creating **Hadoop Clusters (Big data)** to analyse and process vast amount of data > the clusters can be made of **hundreds of EC2 instances**.

EMR takes care of all the provisioning and config, autoscaling  and integrated with spot instances.

Use cases: big data, data processing, ML, web indexing

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/86a65e3a-b5e3-4e41-8383-70403e3b5130)


## EMR - Node types and purchasing

**Master node** manage the cluster, coordinate, manage health - long running
**Core Node** Run tasks and store data - long running
**Task Node (optional)** Just to run tasks - usually spot

**Purchasing options:**
  - On demand: reliable, predictable, won't be terminated
  - Reserved (min 1 yr): cost savings (EMR will automatically use if available)
  - Spot instances: cheaper, can be terminated less reliable - recommended for task nodes

Can have long running, cluster or transient (temporary) cluster

# Amazon QuickSight

**Serverless machine learning-powered business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards**

## Converting data into Parquet format

Parquet is good for Athena as it's column based

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/167db04b-f455-48f5-b694-54d12509260c)


We use glue ETL to convert it into a Parquet format.

## Glue - Nice to know

**Glue Job Bookmarks:** Prevent re-processing old data

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/dc9a51b5-be62-4414-ac4b-9adb1f548735)


**Glue Elastic Views:** 
  - Combine and replicate data across multiple data stores using SQL
  - No custom code, glue monitors for changes in the source data, serverless
  - Leverages a virtual table

**Glue DataBrew** Clean and normalize data using pre-built transformation

**Glue Studio:** New GUI to create, run and monitor ETL jobs in Glue

**Glue Streaming ETL**: (Built on APach Spark Structured streaming) 

# AWS Lake formation

Data lake = central place to have all your data for analytics purposes

Fully managed service that make it easy to setup a **data lake in days**

Discover, cleanse, transform, and ingest data into your data lake

It automates many complex manual steps (collecting, cleansing, moving, cataloging data) and de-duplicate

Combine structured and unstructured data in lakes.

**Out-of-the-box source blueprints:** (AWS Services that can feed into lake) - S3, RDS, Relational and NOSQL DB

**Fine grained access control of your applications (row and column-level)**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/eac84e72-e828-44bd-8cd9-3343c9045f25)

## Why Lakes are so powerful?

In the below example we could tighten our permissions in Athena, Quicksight, S3, RDS, Aurora - which becomes a pain so having a centralized permission where we can give access control at the column + row level makes it very powerful.

# Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)

Alternative to Amazon Kinesis

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/b26b24c8-cd65-4daf-b10d-85dd152a33bb)


Fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS

  - Allow you to create, update, delete clusters
  - MSK creates and manages Kafka brokers nodes and Zookeper nodes for you
  - Deploy the MSK cluster in your VPC, multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA)
  - Automatic recovery from common Apache Kafka failures
  - Data is stored on EBS volumes **for as long as you want**

Option for **MSK Serverless**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/dab3dacd-7544-40a2-9a5d-f7cc7d452c79)


## Kinesis vs MSK

**Kinesis**

- has a 1MB message size limit
- Data streams with shards
- Scale via shard splitting (Out) and merging (scale in)
- TLS In-flight encryption
- KMS at rest

**MSK**
- 1MB Default, config for higher (example: 10mb)
- Kafka topics with partitions
- can only partitions to a topic
- PLAINTEXT or TLS encryption
- KMS at rest
- Keep data for as long as u want (if u pay for underlying EBS)
