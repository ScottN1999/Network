# Scalability and HA


## Scalability

## Vertical Scaling
- Resizing EC2 instance
- t3.large â†’ t3.xlarge
- Each resize requires a reboot - disruption
- Larger instances often carry a $ premium
- There is an upper cap on performance - instance size
- No application modification required
- Works for ALL applications - even monoliths

## Horizontal Scaling
- Adds more instances as load increases
- Load Balancer Between servers and customers
- Distribute load over all servers
- Sessions, sessions, sessions
- Requires application support OR off-host sessions (stateless sessions)
- No disruption when scaling
- Connections can be moved between servers (if stateless sessions without disruption)
- Often less expensive - no large instance premium
- More granular

## HA

High availability refers to ensuring the service continues without fault, this usually can be implemented by spreading EC2s across different AZs - HA does not equate to scalability however horizontal scaling does follow the same principals.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Layer 7** load balancer
    - Listens on **HTTP/HTTPS**
- **No other Layer 7 protocols (**SMTP, SSH, Gaming)
    - And **NO TCP/UDP/TLS Listeners**
- L7 content type, cookies, custom headers, user location and app behaviour
- HTTP HTTPS (SSL/TLS) always terminated on the ALB - **no unbroken SSL** (security teams!)
    - **A new connection is made to the application**
- ALBs **MUST** have **SSL** certs if **HTTPS** is used
- ALBs are **slower** than **NLB**. More levels of the networks stack to process
- Health checks **evaluate application health**
    - Layer 7

## ALB Rules

- Rules **direct connections** which arrive at a listener
- Processed in **priority order**
- **Default rule = catchall**
- **Rule Conditions:** host-header, http-header, http-request-method, path-pattern, query-string and source-ip
- **Actions:** forwards, redirects, fixed-response, authenticate-oids & authenticate-cognito
