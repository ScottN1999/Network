# Network/Security write-ups

##  - Understanding this repo
    - CTFS
        The generic cybersec worker github experience zzz
        
    - Simulating networks
       Create virtualised enterprise networks and understand staging servers, likely will try GNS3 as well if I have the motivation ...
       
    - AWS
        As I'm doing my AWS SAA, I will likely dive into playing around with Lambda functions and see what we can tinker.


### UPDATES:
- Write-up for networking sims has started, making decent progress.

### Objections:
To replicate working on-premise network that demonstrates core knowledge of a network, key goals is to demonstrate how a core > distribution > and access layer switch will work for edge devices and key infrastructure within a network whilst demonstrating IAM capabilities and following best practices from a cyber security sector :)

### Notes: 
Write-up of cloud infrastructure is my planned goal too, likely to be in AWS
AWS put on hold as of 2024, focussing on AD management
