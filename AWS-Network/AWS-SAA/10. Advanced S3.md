# S3 Moving between Storage classes

You can transition objects between storage classes - for IA objects, move them to standard IA > for archive objects that you don't need fast access to, move them to Glaicer or Glacier Deeper Archive

Moving objects can be done manually but can be automated using **Lifecycle Rules**

## Lifecycle Rules

**Transition Actions** - configure objects to transition to another storage class
  - Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
  - Move to glaciver for archiving after 6 months

**Expiration Actions** - Configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
  - Access logs can be set to delete after 365 days
  - **Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled)**
  - Can be use to delete incomplete multi-part uploads

Rules can be create with a certain prefix (example:s3://mybucket/mp3/*)
Rules can be created for a certain objects Tags (example:Department:Finance)

## AWS Analytics - Storage class analysis
Help you decide when to transition objects to the right storage class > recommendations for **Standard** or **Standard IA**
  - Does NOT work One-Zone IA or Glacier

Report is updated daily - it takes 24 to 48 hours to start seeing data analysis > **S3 analytics is a good first step to put together Lifecycle Rules (or improve them)**

## S3 Requester Pays
In general, bucket owners pay for all S3 storage and data transfer costs associated with their bucket.

With **Requester Pays buckets,** the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request of the data download from the bucket.

Helpful when you want to share large dataset with other accounts - the requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)
