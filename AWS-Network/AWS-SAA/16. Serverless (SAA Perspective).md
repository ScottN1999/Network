# AWS Lambda

Easy pricing 
- Pay per request and compute time
- Free tier of 1 million Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time

It is integrated with the whole suite of AWS services - as well with many programming languages.

Easy monitoring through CloudWatch - easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM), increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

## Lambda Limits 

**Per-region**

**Execution**

- Memory allocation : 128 MB - 10GB (1 MB increments)
- Maximum execution time: 15 minutes
- Environment variables: 4kb
- Disk cap in the "function container" (in /tmp): 512MB to 10GB
- Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)

## Lambda SnapStart

Improve your Lambda functions performance up to 10x at no extra cost for Java 11 and above.

When it's enabled, function is invoked from a pre-intialized state (no function initialization from scratch)

When you publish a new version:
- Lambda initalizes your function
- Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function
- Snapshot is cached for low-latency access

## Lambda@Edge & CloudFront Functions

Many modern applications execute some form of the logic at the edge

**Edge function:**
- A code that you write and attach to the CloudFront distributions
- Runs close to your users to minimize latency

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/5428c1aa-7b65-4137-8363-900265ce2822)


CloudFront provides two types: **CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge**, you don't have to manage any servers, deployed globally

Use case: Customize the CDN content
  - Website Security and Privacy
  - Dynamic Web app at the edge
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
  - Intelligently Route Across Orgins and Data Centers
  - Bot mitigation at the edge
  - Real-time image transformation
  - A/B Testing
  - User authentication and authorization
  - User prioritization
  - User tacking and analytics

Pay only what you use

**CloudFront Functions**

Typical CloudFront communications:

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1ef94e8b-6ac6-4549-a349-f50a02d1794f)

CloudFront Functions are lightweight functions written in JS - it's for high-scale, latency sensitive CDN customizations. Sub-ms startup times, millions requests/second

Used to change Viewer requests and responses:
**- Viewer Request:** After CloufFront receives a request from a viewer
**- Viewer Response:** Before CF forward the response to the viewer

Native feature of CF

**Lambda@Edge**

Lambda functions written in NodeJS or Python
Scales up to 1000s of requests/second

Used to change CF requests and responses:
- Viewer request - after CF receives a request from a viewer
- Origin Request - Before CF forward the request to the origin
- Origin Response - After CF receives the response from the origin
- Viewer Response - before CF forwards the response to the viewer

Author your functions on AWS Region, the CF replicates to its locations

## Lambda in VPC

Lambda by default is launched in an AWS-owned VPC - therefore outside your VPC and won't work with any services within the VPC.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/f8500110-1055-4d95-9694-2b246892c2c4)

We can launch Lambda in a VPC to fix this - You must define the VPC ID, the subnets and NSG. Lambda then will create an ENI in your subnets

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/50f5a65d-7af0-45f6-855e-33831603086f)

## Lambda with RDS Proxy

If Lambda functions directly access your DB, they may open too many connections under high load

RDS Proxy
- Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
- Improve availability by reducing by 66% the failover time and preserving connections
- Improve security by enforcing IAM auth and storing creds in Secrets Manager

**The Lambda functions must be deployed in your VPC, because RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible**

## Invoking Lambda from RDS and Aurora
Allows you to process **data events** from within a DB

Supported for **RDS for PostgreSQL and AUrora MySQL**

**Must allow outbound traffic to your Lambda function** from within your DB instance ( Public, NAT GW, VPC Endpoints)

**DB instance must have the required perms to invoke the Lambda function (lambda resource-based Policy and IAM Policy)**

# AWS DynamoDB

Fully managed DB, highly available with replication across multiple AZs. NoSQL DB - not a relational DB - with transaction support.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/23ce64f3-55d9-4d5f-baf2-ba59d65828ac)


Scales to massive workloads, distrubuted database.

Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage - fast and consistent in performance (single-digit millisecond).

Integrated with IAM for sec, authorization, and administration.

Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities, no maintenance or patching, always available.

2 Table classes:
- Standard
- IA

DynamoDB is made of **tables**

Each table has a **Primary Key**, each table have an infinite number of items (=rows), each table has attributes) can be added over time - can be null).

Max size of an item is 400kb

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/c8976b54-580d-48d7-a653-672116dcc988)


Data types supported are:
- Scalar Types: String, number, binary, boolean, Null
- Document types - List, Map
- Set types - String set, number set, binary set

**IMPORTANT TO KNOW FOR EXAM - DYNAMODB IS GOOD FOR RAPIDLY EVOLVING SCHEMAS**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/e8990e6f-21e0-4084-9ee4-d399f3be5a11)

**Managing capacitiy:**

Read/Write capacity modes:

**Provisioned Mode (default)**
- You specify the number of reads/writes per second
- You need to plan cap beforehand
- Pay for **provisioned** Read Capacity Units (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU)
- Possibility to add **auto-scaling** mode for RCU and WCU
- Is good for predictable load, and for cost-saving

**On-demand mode**
- Read/writes automatically scale up and down with your workloads
- No cap planning needed
- Pay for what you use, more expensive
- Great for **unpredictable** workloads, **steep sudden spikes**

# DynamoDB Advanced 

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Fully-managed, highly available, seamless in-memory cache for DynamoDB

Helps solve read congestion by caching - allows for **microseconds latency for cached content**

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/c509435d-aef6-4666-9672-14e27069825e)

## DynamoDB - Stream Processing

Ordered stream of item-level modifications (create/update/delete) in a table

Use cases:
- React to changes in real-time (welcome email to users)
- Real-time usage analytics
- Insert into derivative tables
- Implement cross-region replication
- Invoke Lambda on charges to your DynamoDB table

**DDB Streams**
- 24 hr retention
- Limited # of consumers
- Process using Lambda triggers, or DDB Stream Kinesis adapter

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/3ba2de31-0935-4f18-b691-a2e957948d2a)


**Kinesis Data Streams (newer)**
- 1 yr retention
- High # of consumers
- Process using Lambda, Kinesis Data Analytics, Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Glue Streaming ETL

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1cd9868d-8b1f-4d15-8027-419463d1f28c)


## DynamoDB Global Tables

- A table that is replicated across different regions (replicates both ways)
- Low latency
- Active-active replication: Applications can **READ** and **WRITE** to the table in any region
- Must enable DDB Streams as a prepreq

## DynamoDB TTL

Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp.

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/539510cf-6c7b-419f-b937-72ba8abb230d)

Usecase: Reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations, web session handling

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1d2d1941-79ca-4fcd-a043-552e2e44d5d6)


## DynamoDB - Backups for DR

Continous backups using point-in-time recovery (PITR)
  - Optionally enabled for the last 35d
  - PITR to any time within the backup windows
  - The recovery process creates a new table

On-deman backups
  - Full backups for long-term retention, until explicitely deleted
  - Doesn't affect performance or latency
  - Can be configured and managed in AWS Backup (enables cross-region copy)
  - The recovery process creates a new table

## DynamoDB - integration with S3

Export to S3 (must enable PITR)
  - Works for any point of time in the last 35d (cos of PITR)
  - Doesnt affect the read capacity of your table
  - Perform data analysis on top DDB
  - Retain snapshots for auditing
  - ETL on top od S3 data before importing back into DDB
  - Export in DDB JSON or ION format

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/a305d638-4f2e-4100-8d4e-cb76aa56c996)


Import from S3
  - Import CSV, DDB JSON or ION format
  - Doesnt consume any write capacity
  - Creates a new table
  - Import errors are logged in CloudWatch

# API Gateway

Good for when a client needs to invoke a Lambda function

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/a2038501-5347-47cd-9744-212bb3890129)


You can do many ways about invoking a lambda function
  - IAM perm directly
  - ALB > expose the Lambda function as a HTTP endpoint
  - API gateway

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/344f5fec-8eea-47a2-a3be-0d8cfe2bb86f)


Lambda + API gateway: No infra to manage

Support for the WebSocket Protocol > Handling API versioning (v1, v2)

- Handle different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Handle security (authentication and authorization)
- Create API keys, handle request throttling
- Swagger / Open API import to quickly define APIs
- Transofrm and validate requests and responses
- Generate SDK and API specifications
- Cache API responses

Integrates with 

Lambda Functions
  - Invoke Lambda function
  - Easy way to expose REST API backed by AWS Lambda

HTTP
  - Expose HTTP endpoints in the backend
  - Example: Internal API on prem, ALB
  - Why? Add rate limiting, caching, user authentication, API keys, etc.

AWS Services
  - Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway?
  - Example: Start an AWS Step function workflow, post a message to SQS
  - Why? Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate control

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/290aa9e7-5362-4028-aec6-d16804b3536e)

Expose any service publicly without giving them access to the service.

## API Gatewau - Endppoint Types

**Edge optimized (default):** For global clients
  - Requests are router through the CloudFront Edge Locations (improves latency)
  - The API Gateway still lives in only one region

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/60a4271e-c96c-407f-8d97-396212bc228d)


**Regional:**
  - For clients within the same region
  - Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strats and the distribution)

**Private**
  - Can only be accessed from the VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
  - Use a resource policy to define access

## API Gateway - Security

**User auth through:**
  - IAM Roles (good for internal applications)
  - Cognito (identity for external users)
  - Custom Auth

**Custom Domain Name HTTPS** security through integration with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

  - If using Edge-Optimized endpoint - then the cert must be in US-EAST-1
  - If uisng regional endpoint, the cert must be in the API gateway regions
  - Must setup CNAME or A-ALias record in Route 53

## Step Functions

Build serverless visual workflow to orchestrate your Lambda functions

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/30f94b1b-d3c1-4f7a-acce-bda919483640)

**Features:** Sequence, parallel, conditions, timeouts, error handling, ..

Integrates with lots of AWS services

possibility of implementing human approval feature

**Use cases:** Order fulfillment, data processing, web apps, any workflow that is sophisticated/complex needing a graph to visualise

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/1a341ee4-6e05-4a0f-b00a-b17d53aef491)


## AWS Cognito

Give users an identity to interact with our web or mobile application

**Cognito User Pools:**
  - Sign in functionality for app users
  - Integrate with API gateway and ALB

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/2cae415b-7918-472f-98de-2cafbb4c91d0)


**Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity)**
  - Provide AWS creds to users so they can access AWS resources directly
  - Integrate with Cognito User Pools and identity provider

**Cognito vs IAM:** We think Cognito when exam mentions "Hundreds of users", "Mobile users", "Auth with SAML"

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/bfeb9289-a205-4f9b-ac25-bb51c5eab50f)


## Cognito User Pools (CUP) - User Features

**Creates a serverless DB of user for your web and mobile apps**

- Simple login: username or email / pwd combo
- Pwd reset
- Email and phone verification
- MFA
- Federated Identities: Facebook, Google, SAML

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/6ab1f08b-9265-40d3-abb7-6111dd6d95f4)


## Cognito User Pools (CUP) - Integration

CUP integrates **with API gateway and ALB**

For API gateway:

![image](https://github.com/UpheldSmile/Virtual-Network/assets/49825639/83eb9292-2954-49d4-b4d4-fd14bc7c86aa)

For ALB:

## Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identities)

Get identites for "Users" so they obtain temporary AWS creds
Users source can be CUP, 3rd party logins, etc..

- Users can the access AWS service directly through API Gaetway
- The IAM policies applied to the credentials are defined in Cognito
- They can be customised based on the user_id for fine grained control
- **Default IAM roles** for authenticated and guest users
