# AWS Organizations 


Global service which allows to managed multiple AWS accounts - the main account is the management account, other accounts are member accounts. Member accounts can only be part of one organization.

Consolidated billing across all accounts - single payment method > pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3 ...)

**Shared reserved instances and Savings Plans discount across account**

**Advantages:**
  - Multi accound vs one account multi VPC
  - Use tagging standards for billing purposes
  - Enable cloudtrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
  - Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account
  - Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes

**Security: Service Control Policies (SCP)**
  - IAM policies applied to OU or Accounts to restrict Users and Roles
  - They do not apply to the management account (full admin power)
  - Must have an explicit allow (does not all anything by default - like IAM)

# IAM Conditions

**aws:SourceIp**: Restrict the client IP **from** which the API calls are being made

**aws:RequestedRegion**: Restrict the region the API calls are made **to**


# IAM Roles vs Resource-Based Policies

When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role.

When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions

**Example:** User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in account B > Use a resouce-based policy - won't have to assume a role.

Supported by: Amazon S3 buckets, SNS topics, SQS queues, etc...

## EventBridge - Security

When a rule runs, it needs permissions on the target > resource-based policy, Lambda, SNS, SQS, etc  

IAM role, Kinesis stream, Systems Manager Run command, ECS task.

# IAM Permissions Boundaries

For users and roles (not groups), allows you to set the max permissions an IAM entity can get.

e.g. If I did allow * for S3, it would allow all S3 actions but nothing else.

# AWS IAM Identity Center

One login (SSO) for all your 
  - **AWS accounts in AWS Organisations**
  - Business cloud applications (e.g, Salesforce, Box, M365...)
  - SAML 2.0 enabled applications
  - EC2 Windows Instances

Identity providers
  - Built-in identity store in IAM Identity Center
  - 3rd party: Active Directory, OneLogin, Okta

# AWS Directory Services

Provides a way of providing AD in AWS

**AWS Managed Microsoft AD**
  - Creates your own AD in AWS, manages users locally, supports MFA
  - Establish "trust" connections with your onprem AD.

**AD Connector**
  - Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to onprem AD, supports MFA
  - Users are managed on the onprem AD

**Simple AD**
  - AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
  - Cannot be joined with onprem AD
