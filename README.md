# Network write-up

## Setting up a basic network via Linux in VirtualBox


UPDATES:
- Write-up still in works
- Most likely will do iterations/sprints to simulate a dev team > how frequent this is depends on my current workload lmao

### Objections:
To replicate working on-premise network that demonstrates core knowledge of a network, key goals is to demonstrate how a core > distribution > and access layer switch will work for edge devices and key infrastructure within a network whilst demonstrating IAM capabilities and following best practices from a cyber security sector :)

Notes: 
Write-up of cloud infrastructure is my planned goal too, likely to be in AWS as Azure gives me brain failure
